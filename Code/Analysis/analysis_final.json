        "review_text": "I was a little worried when I noticed that our usual Renaissance Marriott (or Grand Chateau) were suddenly a higher points class and we had to settle for the Springhill Suites.  No reason to worry though.  The Springhill is actually better than the other two higher level Marriott properties.  Friendly lobby, easy check in, clean good smelling lobby and rooms (no cigarettes of course) and no casino noise, great breakfast buffet included in the room.  Decent size room - good beds.  Nothing to complain about ;-)  Highly recommend.  A little further away from the train station but for a short evening strip visit a taxi split among 4 people is cheaper or same price anyways."

        "review_text": "As a loyal Hyatt hotel member with a Hyatt Hotel credit card, I booked a room several weeks in advance for $450 a night. Ten days before check in the hotel LOWERED the rate to $288.  I called to ask them to please make an adjustment, but they absolutely refused to do anything.  Not lower my rate, not allow me parking, not allowing me a complimentary breakfast.  All the manager would say is that my rate was non-refundable.  I was NOT asking for a refund.  The manager basically told me TOUGH LUCK.  WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN."

        "review_text": "Maybe I was expecting too much from a 3 star hotel but I was disappointed.  When we arrived we had difficulty getting round the scaffolding to get our cases through the front door and nobody came to help us.During our stay 1 of the two lifts was out of operation and I got the impression that it was unlikely to be mended.We could not sit on our balcony as there was a constant shower of water from the aircon above.  We reported this but nothing was done about it. Our aircon left a constant pool of water on the balcony.The safe and the toilet roll holder were both hanging off the wall.  If you could get on the balcony, part of the view was ok but straight ahead were guys carrying out building work on flats opposite and creating lots of dust.Breakfast was provided but it was buffet style and reminiscent of a youth hostel with plastic plates, eaten at bench tables, if you could find a seat, or otherwise on settees in the reception.  The food was ok but the conditions were poor.  The hotel did not have a bar or restaurant.On the positive side the staff were friendly, our room was clean and adequate and the pool basic but ok. We were due to return but cancelled."

        "review_text": "We spent 4 days at the Fairmont Washington in July 2015. We arrived early on the morning of July 5 and despite a full house at the hotel on July 4, they were able to get us an early check in. Our room was spacious and well furnished. The lemonade and board games in the lobby every evening at 5 pm were a nice break from the heat of the day. We went sightseeing during the day, took a break between 5-7 pm and then went for dinner almost every night. The lobby was a relaxing place to enjoy live piano music, free lemonade, games and food/drinks from the lobby bar. The hotel's location is excellent and the concierge was friendly and helpful. I would return to the Fairmont Washington for business or vacation again."

        "review_text": "Due to status with Marriott, I always try to stay at the Marriott on personal and business travel.  It just so happens, this Marriott location is in a PRIME location.Save money and DONT RENT A CAR in Seattle, especially not necessary at this hotel.  Plus you will pay a hefty overnight car parking fee.I recommend getting an ocean view room.My son loved the gaming consoles in the lobby.  He played Fifa at least once a day - which was a treat for him since we do not have this at home.The breakfast buffet was great with amazing omelets.Just up the street from Pikes Place, which is an easy walk to the 1st Starbucks in the morning before the crowd is insane.  Also, see the fish market without the crowd.We walked to CenturyLink field.  Super close to the ferris wheel on the water.For any farther locations, take an easy UBER to get to your location for a few bucks."

        "review_text": "When I was looking to return to Waikiki, I wanted to stay at another Aqua hotel as previous stays had been great. Based on price I booked in here. To be honest When I read all the reviews I was put off HOWEVER, this hotel is awesome! Good reviews always mention the staff, and I agree they are all wonderful, they make you feel so welcome. We stayed in a Junior Lanai Suite, number 908 and it was perfect for us. The room was HUGE and the bathroom clean and had everything we needed. The Lanai was massive too and was awesome to enjoy a few longboards on. The hotel is right by the International Marketplace, and a really short walk to the beach. For the price it is perfect. There are heaps of food options nearby, and the DVD service was awesome too. I would definitely come back and stay here, it is so handy. We stayed for 12 nights (couple) and really had no complaints. This hotel is not the Hilton, or The Modern, and no you  probably won't get as many Instagram likes tagging yourself here, but seriously, you are in Hawaii, who cares. My ONLY suggestion would be that perhaps they need to have more people working on the front desk, as often at check in and out there were long queues. If you are questioning whether to stay here, don't request room 908, or book a junior lanai suite and have a good time outside of your hotel room! Also, if you are looking for a great tour, go see Bob just down from Ross and he will hook you up! Mahalo!"

        "review_text": "Omni hotels are hard to beat - from the minute you walk thru the door - they are fantastic.We stayed for two nights (9-5 and 9-6) after a couple of days in Napa.  Even though we arrived early (11 AM) and anticipated that our luggage would be held, the front desk found two rooms for us - even in close proximity to the couple we were traveling with .  The room was great.  My only complaint would be that we backed to the elevator and could hear the elevator making runs (sounded like a laundry cart running?) and that went on all the time.  We did not complain as we did not want the hassle of moving.  The room was #1423 - may want to not take that one!  Other than that - the room was fantastic.The location of the hotel is very good.  We parked our vehicle and did not have a need to get it out until we headed to the airport yesterday.  It was any easy walk to Chinatown, North Shore and the Pier.  The cable car stops in front of the hotel and the Big Bus is a couple of blocks away.Concierge goes above and beyond - from recommendations on restaurants and making reservations and walking directions - they go above and beyond to make your trip memorable.We would absolutely stay again."

After 15 years of international travel, I can honestly say this is one of the best places I have ever stayed in. The energy and beauty of this place is amazing. Enjoy!"

        "review_text": "This hotel is not where you want to stay for cleanliness, service, or location. I stayed here for a business trip with multiple colleagues none of us had a good experience here.Let me explain, they have 3 elevators. At no point of my 5-night stay did all of them work at the same time. I had to use one of the elevators located by the vending machines, and the button for the 5th floor didn't work. When I told the front desk, they said that it worked perfectly fine for them earlier disregarding my comment.They neglect to inform you that the Cafe is closed on Mondays, so you go downstairs at 7:30am to grab a cup of coffee, and it isn't open. There is no sign that informs you that they are in fact closed.The keys that they give you will NOT always work, three times I have had to get them re-programed for the door.The \"housekeeping\" that comes to clean will not touch your bed if you leave items on your bed, that being said the bathroom doesn't get cleaned either.DO NOT WALK THE STREETS AT NIGHT. The hotel is in a very shady area, where there are strange people walking around at night, for this reason there is 2 large security guards making sure that you belong (I guess that is a good thing) but it speaks volumes in and of itself.The bar was ok, good place for drinks.The staff is basic, any concern you have they pass on to someone else. They do not go out of their way to make you happy.The internet is very choppy, it will not work all the time.The TV channels are limited but not all events can be watched.Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Please beware!!!!"

Great location, we walked everywhere.The staff were 5 star, from the minute we checked in to the day we left.  Front desk staff were always helpful. Housekeeping were great, as well as the Restaurant staff & Security.The menu at Loco House Restaurant was small, but food was good. You get a free breakfast when you book direct with hotel.  We also received free airport shuttle by booking direct.  Hotel also has laundry facility & there's a car rental right in the lobby.The room itself was visibly dated (old doors, fixtures ect) but it was Very Clean & Comfortable.   You can see where there have been repairs done by the poor paint & plaster jobs. There is a fridge & coffee maker in the room, & the hotel has a hospitality room with a microwave if you wanted to heat up anything.  Our flight home was in the evening, the hotel accommodated a late check out & held our bags until we were ready to leave.  Also, there are showers in the hospitality room that we took advantage of, to freshen up before our flight.  One issue that you may want to be aware of, is the hotel is on a corner, & there is a lot of traffic noise.Over all, If you're looking for 5 star luxury accommodations, this is not for you.  But if you want a Clean, Comfortable & Affordable room in Waikiki, with friendly staff,.. I highly recommend this hotel. We would stay there again."

        "review_text": "Absolutely love this hotel.  The front desk staff, Corinna, Brandon and Charlie are very friendly and accommodating.  I enjoyed every interaction that I had with them.  The hotel itself is very charming.  I read previous reviews that stated the rooms are small.  It is not the biggest room I've stayed in, but we have 3 adults with suitcases and plenty of room.  The location is great.  We are about a half mile from the DuPont Subway station.  About the same distance from Adams Morgan, which is a neighborhood that has a lot of restaurants and pubs to choose from.  The zoo is about a mile from us and an easy walk.  We are already discussing our next trip to DC and staying here again."

        "review_text": "Silver Cloud Lake Union is the perfect spot to stay in Seattle. The hotel is clean, comfortable and has friendly staff. The complimentary breakfast is excellent- great variety, plentiful, and a beautiful view of Lake Union while you eat. The location is ideal. Just far enough outside the downtown bustle makes the area quiet yet right across the street are wonderful restaurants and lake activities. The hotel is easily accessible to the city and sights via the reliable and quick street car. I found the free hotel shuttle not as convenient, as the one driver on staff could not accommodate all the requests for pick ups in the downtown area. The shuttle is also hindered by city traffic where the street car is not. I would absolutely stay here again."

Last year we spent a few nights at an alternative 5 star hotel due to this hotel's availability and to be honest does not even come close. We stay in the beautiful high ceiling historic rooms. The breakfast staff are amazing and treat us like royalty. It is personal, never overcrowded and there is tranquility and history all around premises. The beach front is the best section of Waikiki and we wouldn't stay anywhere else."

        "review_text": "The rooms were beautiful, and the food at the club level buffet was awesome. Our only complaint was that the spa area was not very zen, and generally didn't wow us. The day we went down to sign up for a service, there was some sort of conference event in a nearby room, and you could hear all the hustle and bustle, so there wasn't a peaceful area to relax in. We also went back for our service the next day, right at the time of the appointment, and there was no one at the desk. We waited for 10 minutes and no one came, so had to go up to the front desk and ask what was going on. However, the spa staff was very friendly and helpful when they did appear."

        "review_text": "Nice size room given the location and price range. It was a nice comfortable bed. The bathroom was small but plenty of counter space and really nice water pressure. It would have been nice to have a dresser (I prefer to take out clothes and fold them instead of hanging them), but that is really no big deal.We visited a friend off the blue line and then also saw Hamilton in Chicago, and it was really convenient to get basically everywhere from where we stayed.The biggest downside is one night when we got back, one of the elevators stopped working. Because of the way the elevator bay is set up, only two elevators would go to the floor we were on. My husband and I as well as about 6 other guests got onto an elevator (it was not jammed pack), and then it went up a floor and then stopped on like the third floor and would not move down or up. Unfortunately, you cannot take the stairs upwards, so we were forced to wait about 10 minutes for the only other elevator to stop on that floor and not be utterly full so we could get up to our room. Luckily, this only happened one night out of the three we were there."

I found the check-in staff slightly indifferent and uninterested in the fact that there was an error in my booking suggesting that I would need to sort it out myself. The room itself was clean but in need of some maintenance. As other reviewers have noted, the noise from adjoining rooms was an issue.The AV facilities during the conference were plentiful and embarrassing.For NZ guests note that the hotel does not exchange NZ dollars, I was directed to Travelex, a metro ride away at Union Station.The most helpful and friendly staff were the two guys who changed the batteries in my TV remote control.All in all, pretty average with room for improvement."

        "review_text": "I was in San Francisco for work, happening to coincide with Fleet Week, which meant hotels in town were all completely booked and exorbitant.  That's how I found myself at the Hilton Financial District.First off, the name is a misnomer.  It's really Chinatown, and Chinese in every respect, including loud Chinese music blasting from the park nearby (given that I live in China, hey, it felt like home).  It's actually a healthy hike to Embarcadero and the Financial District, although it's location also makes it much closer to Chinatown and North Beach for dining.  I understand that this used to be a Holiday Inn that upgraded to a Hilton (usually I see hotels downgrading, not upgrading), and not sure what they added to make this a Hilton quality hotel.Service was pretty basic.  Some employees were very pleasant, and others were just perfunctory.The room was a decent size, and had a lovely partial view of the Bay and Coit Tower.  Cleaning staff were polite.Overall, however, for over $400 a night, this was a pretty raw deal.  I appreciate it was Fleet Week, so everything was overpriced, but I'll say this felt more like the Holiday Inn it used to be rather than the Hilton it is supposed to be."

It's a quick walk around the block to a Metro stop - else, closest thing (grocery/CVS/museums) are 3 blocks in any direction.

        "review_text": "This was one of our rare family vacations since I was living overseas and didn't have time for family vacations in the US like we used to have yearly in the past.As such, I was so looking forward to this trip as I hadn't been to Honolulu in more than 30 years!I flew in from the mainland and met my father here, but my brother and his family and friends would only join us at a later date. So, since there were going to be so many of us,  we really wanted to stay as close to each other as possible....I contacted reservations weeks before and they were so friendly and helpful on the phone, and promised to try their best to accommodate our request, but due to the extremely busy holiday season they couldn't make any promises.I arrived at the hotel after about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport.....the cab fare was pretty hefty and I'd suggest taking Uber if you can....the fare is almost half. As we drove into the hotel driveway I was immediately greeted by the hotel staff who welcomed me and offered to help with my bags, but I didn't have much and could handle it myself. The hotel lobby is totally open....no windows separating the driveway from the lobby, and no AC.....just nice fresh Hawaiian air.Check in was a breeze.....Victor was really nice and friendly and took care of me, and apparently he also attended to my father earlier, but his room wasn't ready yet. Unfortunately, only my room was ready and my father's would have to wait till 3pm. I went up to my room and ohoh.....this is not what the room looked like on the website! I got a room facing the back...not a bad view....but the room had small windows, no balcony, and just dark and dingy like a dated motel room.....at first I thought no big deal, but then after a few minutes I started to feel really claustrophobic....I had to change rooms. I went all the way back down to the reception and spoke to Victor about this....he was really understanding and fixed me up with another room, but it wouldn't be ready till after 3pm.....no problem, I said.3pm passed and we had been sitting in the lobby for an hour or so...finally we were called that our rooms were finally ready! Yay! OMG! This room was so much better!!! The bedroom and living room both had sliding doors to balconies, and there was actually a very nice partial view of the beach and ocean! My father got the same room, but on a much lower floor and his view was even more awesome!....with a view of the pool too. The room still looked a bit dated, but it was much brighter so the dated look wasn't so obvious.....it was still very comfortable, clean, and well kept. I liked that they had flat screen TVs in both rooms, a low light bedside digital clock,, iron and ironing board in the cupboard, hot water kettle, coffee maker, a couple of glasses, a mini fridge, and some basic bathroom amenities. The bedroom and living room have separate AC controls, which is nice if you have someone sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room and prefers a different room temperature or fresh air by keeping the sliding door open. There is plenty of lighting in the room and what I found neat was that the lamps had 2 prong electrical outlets at their bases. And yes, there is a room safe for your valuables.About the location of the hotel, it just doesn't get much better. There is a mini market located just at the lifts at the Hula Tower (closer to the beach)....there's also an ABC mini mart across the road, and pretty much every corner of every block. But other than that, there are tons of all kinds of shops right at the hotel's doorsteps and within walking distance to the main happening street of Kalakaua Ave where you have tons of shopping, street entertainment, great restaurants, etc..... there seemed to be a at least a dozen Japanese restaurant at every block in Waikiki!Buffet breakfast was included and the quality and selection was quite good...I particularly enjoyed the fresh local pineapple and melons.....there's an egg station for omelets, but the line was always too long so I never got to try it. I stuck with the regular hot breakfast which included scrambled egg, breakfast potatoes, and the mix up offerings of French toast or waffles, or pancakes and sausages or bacon, etc....I liked the chicken sausages, but they aren't offered every day. The drinks station is located separately, and this was a good idea to relieve the crowding at the food area. The dining next to the pool, but it can get really packed depending on the time you come down for breakfast....a card is is provided in the rooms to tell you at what times are peak and what times are less crowded.There's also a small gym in the Aloha Tower which I used as much as I could....it had a bike, a few steppers/elliptical trainers, treadmills, a cable rack, dumbbells and benches, etc. There are a couple of wall mounted TVs in case you get bored on the machines.....the machines look quite new and are well maintained, but the personal screens are not hooked up to cable tv. There is a water dispenser and towels also provided.Wonderful experience, but I think this hotel is better geared to toward families with kids. My brother's family had a great time!Oh, consider the room you get as anything facing the pool you'll here the live band playing at happy hour.....with free alcoholic drinks and snacks.....nice touch."

And did we really LOVED the staff, It is the employees who make Avenue Suites a great place to stay.Tess, Ann, Darrell and Saif all went above and beyond their job descriptions. We are not seasoned travelers and have a son with Down Syndrome, which made our visit to DC a bit challenging. The staff  worked very hard at simplifying our stay. Guiding us on local transportation, hailing Taxi vans for our family of 5, providing umbrellas on stormy days, giving great suggestions on dining, site seeing and tourism tips regarding how to maximize our time and money, even booking our reservations for the BIgBus night tour! They were like personal assistants-travel guides making us feel like we were the only guests in the building. That incredible staff was like the big bow that topped our great summer vacation. I will add that the building is modern and we had a beautiful view from the 10th floor. The icy fruit infused H2O in the lobby was ever so refreshing on the hotter DC days, housekeeping was kind, attentive and generous. Everyone had great attitudes and you could tell they loved their jobs. We enjoyed having a working kitchen and liked easy access to Trader Joes. We miss you all and cannot wait for a return visit"

Both the ladies that did the facials and massages were wonderful. It is a very small spa. No locker rooms or saunas. Just 2 rooms used for facials and massages. If you are looking for a quiet spa with warm friendly service then this is the spa for you. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and looked beautiful. I know my friend who lives in DC plans to be back and if I ever visit her again in DC I will be back as well."

I would definitely recommend to stay in this room and the upgrades are totally worth it ( free continental breakfast , and appetizers with wines for happy hour) thank you for the great stay!"

Although stay at the club level might have had a role to play in my experience, the staff was always very warm and the SF property is world class. The fitness center was very well equipped with the latest techno-gym equipment. Front desk was very professional and warm at both check-in and check-out. Housekeeping staff checked in for any special requirements. Fitness center housekeeping staff acknowledged me as a guest, which is not always the case. Club lounge manager was so gracious to stand up and welcome me when the elevator reached the club level. Little things go so far in the hospitality industry. It is a bit of an uphill climb from the Financial District in case you are into walking"

        "review_text": "Stayed here for four nights during the RSA conference which just takes over the entire city.  I remember this hotel as a Westin previously and has recently changed ownership (and I say for the better).   Was not expecting much as I prefer smaller boutique hotels but was very pleasantly surprise.    Room was quiet, great views, good internet speeds and of course centrally located (very close to the Moscone Center).I usually do not eat/drink at hotel restaurants as I prefer to visit local smaller places, however, we had a number of meetings at the hotel restaurant due to the conference. Even though it was busy due to the conference next door, the restuarant and lobby bar were excellent places to entertain/meet with clients.   We started off each day with the breakfast buffet (have to love a place that has fresh salmon and smoked trout along with the ususal breakfast items).The manager at the restaurant (Russell Dunkley) was especially gracious/professional and you can that it rubbed off on his staff.   Special thanks to the following servers which went out of their way to make me and my clients feel invited/comfortable over the four days.   Chris, Cecilia, Walter, Samantha and John.Due to our experience, We will be booking four rooms to stay for next years event."

        "review_text": "We decided to try a new hotel this time and chose the ANANTARA Siam as we have stayed with this chain before and they are usually excellent.  We paid a whopping 3500Baht extra each night for Kasera Lounge (Executive) access as again the lounges are beautiful.  Imagine our dismay when we we taken to a small room with what looked like mismatched office furniture and told this is the lounge.  Apparently  they are doing renovations but omitted to mention this when we booked!    This was disgraceful but rather than make a scene we stayed quiet.   We were taken to a newly finished room which was rather nice but the smell of varnish or something was strong so I suffered from sinus for the time we were there.   The room was fully prepaid so we had no option but to stay.   Breakfast was very good in itself but seem to be scattered all over the place.  The first day we were seated in a room that appeared to be a conference room with two large tables in the center and coffee table type by the window which smelled strongly of cigarette smoke    We refused that room the next day!   Children were running madly every day that they were there and I felt sorry for the staff trying to get some control.  It doesn't make for a pleasant breakfast experience.   The spa is beautiful but very expensive so I went each day to a spa located  in the building next door which was very reasonable.   The pool is very nice but the pool towels have definitely seen better days with stains and ragged edges on them all, not up to five star standard.    The thing that made the hotel stay enjoyable over all were the staff, they were excellent, helpful and friendly in every department"

        "review_text": "DC can be a bewildering place to visit, with a seemingly infinite array of identikit hotels: old style grand, with plush furnishings, steak breakfasts and names that nod to diplomacy and privilege. It's also an expensive city to stay in and two or three hundred dollars a night doesn't buy much more than a basic hotel room.I've stayed in a few charmless establishments here and the Fairfax is the first hotel in Washington I would return to.  It's very well situated on Mass Avenue and well serviced by public transport.  The staff are very friendly and the rooms large and well appointed.  It has a proper hotel bar (rather than just a space in the lobby where drinks are served) which serves good, interesting food.I give it three stars, rather than four, as the room I stayed in was a little tired and could do with some decorative retouching.  Also the (accessible) bathroom was quite cramped.  Nonetheless I will probably stay here again on my next visit to DC."

We didn't deal with anyone in the lobby or at reception that didn't provide great service.Location is great and, in an expensive city, the rates seemed fair if not reasonable. Didn't eat there so can't comment or dining.Karren at the front desk did a great job helping track down our airline lost luggage and Bryan made a great dinner recommendation....Catch 15, an Italian place.

There was confusion and a notice of lack service. When I finally figured out and found check in was on the 12th floor I had to ask what was going on outside.The restaurant was closed in the lobby area and no room service due to the strike.The room was as always clean and nice.For 300.00 a night why charge 14.95 for in room internet?Aren\u2019t those days over?"

The grand porches give this hotel a special ambiance. The room we stayed in was fairly small, but very comfortable. We had a lovely dinner in the restaurant and breakfast was very good. When I think of Waikiki, I see myself sipping on a MaiTai at the Beach Bar at the Moana Surfrider! A must when visiting Waikiki."

        "review_text": "This is a modern hotel in a very good location if you want to explore the city. We stayed two nights just to get a glimpse of BANGKOK and it was perfect. Rooms were good but not special. Location is short walk from the Metro (Sukhamvit) and Skytrain (Akok) which is great to use once you are confident. Soi Cowboy red light strip is just behind the Metro. Worth a quick walk through just to experience it. Pool is really nice and breakfast superb. Staff were OK but nowhere near as friendly as we expected. Typical city attitude.Breakfast excellent but drinks and food otherwise quite expensive.We visited the weekend market on the Metro, China Town and did a river cruise (not great as river is rank). Do an organised tour of the temples and Palace. They are fabulous. Lady-boy cabaret show is a hoot if a bit unnerving! Careful of the Tuk Tuks, They are cheap and fun but will kidnap you to a local tailor. Be strong. Tell them you own a tailor shop in England!I would have given this five stars but had constant trouble with the room safe and got no real apologies. Wasted two hours of my short time there whilst it was sorted. At one point they were talking of \"blowing it open\"!!!!!!!Overall would recommend as perfect for a short break."

Unfortunately, it was so windy we did not stay long.The pool area is smaller and consistently crowded.Loved the walking - was able to get in a few miles each morning.Marriott gave coffee vouchers to Starbucks but it was always SO crowded.Better to find a bakery close by.Lolo\u2019s Surf cantina was next door and a great find.As a points traveler, we are used to better perks; however, I\u2019d return for the location alone!"

This is how my stay went -1. Arrived 5 pm, checked in.2. Booked Double bed with balcony wasn't ready.3. Told them about my dinner party4. We were asked to wait; they offered soft drinks while we waited.5. Rooms were to be ready in 30 minutes6. At 7 pm I told them I cannot wait any longer; they said room is almost ready and is being inspected!7. They offered me a king with a sofa bed that is ready. I made a compromise and took it. They should have given me that option at 5 pm!8. As a courtesy, they offered free breakfast.9. Housekeeping came to make our sofa bed, it took them almost 45 minutes. Most of the staff are freshers and learning that causing all the backlog and delay to customers.10. By the time we could leave and reach our dinner party it was 9 pm, so late!11. Nightmare continues12. After we reached our room at midnight the lights in room wouldn't turn off. After trying to reach housekeeping learned that the \u201dadvanced\u201d lighting system is malfunctioning. The maintenance guy had to remove bulbs manually :) to turn them off. If rooms are \u201dinspected\u201d as they claim this shouldn't happen.13. In the morning we found the iron not working, did not bother to call housekeeping as we ran out of patience. Again, if rooms are \u201dinspected\u201d as they claim this shouldn't happen.14. Cigarette butts lying all around in the balcony, \u201dinspected\u201d huh?15. Lastly, found a ridiculous note on their in-room pencil \u201dstole this from Watergate hotel\u201d not sure if this was sarcasm :)But at all times found the staff was very polite and apologetic to all the issues; probably they are used to it.$400/day we need things to work, without apology. Days Inn, I can understand!Wonder why \u201dinspected\u201d is used and keep customer waiting at the lobby, is it just to buy additional time, while you train your staff at customer\u2019s expense?"

This is not a sporting event but the future of our country.  The choice is serious and should not be used for a hotel's amusement.  I am so offended that you have to identify as a Clinton or Trump supporter to check in.  If I had another hotel I would have walked out.

Breakfast offered extensive Asian and western staples, juices and fruits, all freshly prepared. We dined in the western restaurant and in the high-end Japanese restaurant. While the western food was fine, we really enjoyed the food and experience in the Japanese restaurant, having been assigned our own personal chef by the lovely manager.While there was an avoidable misunderstanding concerning the features of our package, which we booked on the hotel's own website, the management staff became quite attentive over our 8-day visit and very generously arranged little bento boxes of goodies waiting in our room from time to time to make up for the glitch.Only disappointment was the swimming pool. OK, it was quite flash being cantilevered from the side of the highest floors of the hotel building (23rd-24th)! But with a very dark finish to its bottom and sides, I found it more than somewhat off-putting. The film entitled \"The Creature from the Black Lagoon\" came to mind. The architect in charge should have his or her head examined! (However, my wife used the pool and was not bothered by the darkness.)"

The sirens don't stop.  The hotel should get better windows or comp dinners for this.  I didn't have a full night's sleep on any of the nights I stayed.In general, the hotel has decent decor and the hotel is clean.  Room Service always did my room up right.  The doorman/bellmen rarely hold open doors or greet.  The front desk in general lacks any proactive assistance.The restaurant had excellent service for both breakfast and dinner.  Every time I went in, I was greeted well and received on-point service.  The decor is nice as well.  I preferred the options at dinner better than the sole option of a buffet for breakfast.On one night, I attended the happy hour in the lobby for a few minutes, both of the staff members were very friendly.I book travel through our company's travel agent.  I was told that since I don't book through the Kimpton website, none of my stays will count?  I had never heard of this before and maybe explains why Kimpton always has had trouble finding my stays.  That being said, I won't be using them for my business travel any more.  That policy makes no sense.OverallOK.  Was not wow'd."

Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The Lobby was spacious and clean with plenty of seating and a bar. The outdoor seating was nice too and a great place for a drink. Our room was 655 facing the enclosed courtyard with a very small balcony. Everything in the room was clean and in working order. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. There was an ironing board and iron, 2 robes and an umbrella in the closet along with an inroom safe large enough for 2 small laptops. The bathroom was clean and stocked with everything needed. My son forgot a toothbrush and the front desk staff gave him a new one along with toothpaste and mouthwash. we ordered dessert from the restaurant and it was delicious. The in room bar was well stocked but we did not purchase any because of the price. They also have valet parking, but we used the spot hero app and paid $60 for the 4 days instead of about $50 per night for the hotel valet. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the DC area and would stay here again if I ever go back to DC."

We couldnt fault our room it was spacious with lovely furniture, a nice big power shower and plenty of wardrobe space.We had a great stay.We used the restaurant for breakfast every morning they were very accommodating and the menu was great. My wife requested something that wasnt exactly onthe menu and they had no difficulty getting it for her. We tried the evening meal at the restaurant and that was very tasty too.The pool has a cool down area to sit in and the rest of it is a paddling pool. Does the trick cooling you down when sunbathing paddling through it but shame not a swimming pool if like me you enjoy swimming. The hotel does make it clear on their website and info.The staff there were amazing and haad great local knowledge. We also got advice and booked a trip with the expedia local guy in the lobby of the hotel. He was very helpful.The concierge were great too. If I was in Oahu again I would use this hotel and use it as a base to see the whole island. Very competitive price for the stay although we found Waikiki to be expensive with the GBP being weak to USD compared to last time I was in the states."

Another bonus was that the room communicating with ours had been allocated to another child of ours, spouse and 3 children. We hadn't asked for this facility but we all enjoyed having it and were grateful the hotel provided it. Convenient for our children too as we could babysit from our room when they stayed out late! The bedroom was beautiful with a lovely large view overlooking the Dupont Circle garden and far out over Washington. Two evenings running we enjoyed excellent New Orleans jazz music coming from the garden.The good points:charming staff constantly doing their best to please guests and regularly taking the trouble to enquire if all was to our satisfactiontop quality bedlovely and spotless roomthorough cleaning and regular sheet changinggreat locationCould be better:Seating in bedroom: Uncomfortable revolving office type armchairs with no padding, low backs, unsuitable for reading or relaxing in.Bathroom: \"design\" style not well thought out.No door to separate bedroom from basin area. Awkward when you have visitors in the room and you need to go to the bathroom and use basin.Hardly any room to keep one's toiletries beside the basin, the worktop is too small.Bath Towel rail directly above the toilet. Never seen this anywhere else before! Looks unhygienic and it's really unpleasant to get your bath towel from that rail and put it back there with the added worry you'll drop the towel in the toilet by accident. Whoever had this mad idea? Especially since there would be enough space for a rail on the wall opposite the toilet, which is on the side you come out of the shower, so towels would be much easier and nearer to reach as you come out all wet.This said our group much enjoyed their stay at the Dupont Circle Hotel overall and had a great time."

The furniture is very traditional (as is the hotel). If you are looking for contemporary appointments you will not find them here. The staff were all polite, interested and helpful. We loved the complimentary fresh fruit in the lobby, the coffee in the morning and the fresh rose placed on the bed with turn down service. These were all very nice little touches that add to the comfortable feel. The location of the hotel is very central. The valet parking is pricey, but all cities have high parking costs due to limited space. All in all a great choice for your next San Francisco visit!"

I booked the hotel through my credit card website and since we were 4 adults and a baby i booked their suite which stated it can sleep 6 people - 2 double bed and 1 queen sofa bed in the living room. When i arrived, we were given 4 access cards but noticed that the room was only prepared and ready for 2 guests. We had no sofa bed, 3 towels total, toiletries for 2 people and 2 coffee mugs etc. and so had to contact the room service/ front desk folks several times to have our basic details sorted out. The staff were friendly and accommodating but i was disappointed we had to \"ask\" for things we already assumed would be taken care of.The biggest let down for me was the steam room. The website didn't mention that the steam room was inside the spa which was closed on Christmas day and I wouldn't use it the day we arrived because we checked in after 6pm and the spa closed at 6. The workout area was however open and accessible like the website stated but the steam room wasn't. This was one of the deciding factors for me to pick Fairmont. I wanted to work out that day after check-in in and use the steam room to relax and spend a wonderful Christmas Eve with the family without the hustle and bustle. I was very disappointed when the front desk person told me that the steam was not accessible because it was within the spa area (which wasn\u2019t specified in the website) and that it was closed for business. I am baffled that Fairmont would specify that as an amenity in their website when it is totally not accessible by guests if they visited for just 1 night. I wouldn\u2019t stay there again and wouldn\u2019t recommend it to my friends or family. Fairmont let me down."

There is a nice selection of food and drink on offer.The room was huge, a lovely bath to relax in. A large comfy bed with soft pillows and complementary soft drinks in the mini bar.As many people have said breakfast is fabulous.  So much choice! I loved the wood fired oven  used to toast the bread.  Would certainly return."

I booked this particular hotel as my husband and I stayed here 14 years previously whilst on honeymoon and had experienced the hotel's high standards and quality service.  I am pleased to say that the Landmark didn't leave us disappointed. It still oozes the same class as it did many years ago.  Staff are very friendly and provide the very best of service. The location is excellent and right next to Nana train station where travelling from is cheap, easy and quick. Bests taxi's any day.  We visited Bangkok Grand Palace and the Reclining Buddha which are both a must see! The MBK mall is easy to get to by train if you are after bargains! Lots of restaurants nearby the hotel with plenty of food choices to suit everyone's requirements. We were there over the Songkran festival - the Thai new year - the water fights are a God send in the heat and plenty of fun!! Would stay at the Landmark Bangkok time and time again."

At check-in, they kept offering points in-lieu of various services that they did not provide or want to provide. No executive lounge, no breakfast, points if I was okay I agreed to no room cleaning, they kept offering points instead.The room was very average. Small room, functional. I've stayed in Courtyards which are much better.I told the front desk that I was expecting a package and to let me know when it arrived. There was no notification. When I called to check, they confirmed that the package had arrived and I should have received a message. They apologized, but it did not matter. You expect better, especially when you are paying top dollar and you a Gold Rewards Member.I will not stay at this hotel when I am back in SFO"

Maybe I am spoiled by Mexico resorts, but the water was a bit skanky, there weren't enough chairs, and the cabanas are only available if you reserve the for (I believe) $40.Location is great (close to Union Station and the Capitol Building) except that it is next door to a fire station.

        "review_text": "Taj Dubai mostly lives up to the Taj brand name. The location of this hotel is central to downtown dubai, and within a few minutes drive to the Burj Khalifa area, with a free shuttle provided by the hotel running on a schedule (we only used it once, and found using taxis more because of convenience) The rooms are relatively spacious, and the Burj khalifa view for the rooms we had booked were spectacular.Check in was a breeze. We checked in on my birthday, and the hotel had gone through a little extra effort to put a few balloons, and a small cake  with a very nice note in one of our rooms.The living space was certainly at the 5 star mark, but not super luxurious.The surroundings were well-kept and clean, and the housekeeping staff were particularly attentive.We dined at most of the restaurants in the hotel, and overall had a good experience. The quality of the Indian food was average, and this was a surprise , given the Taj brand! The same dishes were of different taste with markedly different portion sizes, which was not expected, and I pointed this out to the duty managers.Breakfast was of the best quality, with a myriad choices, and some regularity in the quality of food that was expected. The staff at breakfast time always went out of their way to cater to all our needs, from getting hot chocolate made for the kids, to fresh fruit milkshakes , and getting specific fresh fruits etc.The big disappointment was ordering room service one night, with a prior discussion about the particular dishes, expected portions etc. with the staff, and then being presented with something that was unexpected and unacceptable, as regards to the quality and portion sizes. Needless to say, I was upset, and made that known.The hotel allowed for us to check-out late, and this was appreciated.If using taxis, just be vigilant of the routes taken. Sometimes we paid almost double the amount as the taxi driver took the more circuitous route, for no reason! Also, no need to use the hotel airport transfers as they are much more expensive than local taxis!Overall, a decent five star hotel, living up to the Taj brand (but not as luxurious or efficient as some of the Taj hotels, for example in India), and certainly the food quality is just average to may be above average!"

Hotel Abri fitted the bill well.We had prepaid for a Queen room but on arrival were upgraded to a King Suite. Nice touch! The room was spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. The extra lounge area was an additional bonus and our room was away from the street which led to a good night's sleep. The bathroom was spacious and there was plenty of hot water.The hotel is less than 5 mins walk from the Powell St BART station and within 5 mins you will find yourself at the Westfield mall or Union Square.Our check out time was extended to 2pm and our bags were held until we left for the airport at 5.15 pm.We would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend this hotel."

        "review_text": "We stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay a lot. The staff at this hotel was great - Sarah, Sharon, and Eva at the front desk were wonderful and very accommodating! It was nice to wake up each morning and enjoy a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge from our room. Breakfast was very good too - lots of items to choose from. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was very small, but very clean. The sink is located outside of the bathroom, but that didn't bother us. Room had a refrigerator and a little sitting area by the window where we could sit and enjoy the view of the bay. The location of this hotel is perfect. It is at the corner of Lombard and Van Ness. It is only a couple of blocks from the \"crooked\" street and a 10 minutes walk to Ghirardelli Square. Public transportation (Muni) is a block away. We walked most of the time as it was more fun discovering San Francisco on foot. We would definitely stay at this hotel again if ever back in San Francisco and would highly recommend this hotel due to its location and staff."

        "review_text": "This hotel is in a great location and close to Georgetown and within walking distance to many shops and restaurants, as well as near metro access options. The rooms are spacious and have well-equipped kitchens for an extended stay. The beds are very comfortable as is all the furniture provided - ample desk, sofa, small eating area and wardrobe with large flat safe. Being located on busy Pennsylvania Avenue, there was a little extra noise to deal with, but not considered a major feature to deal with. The staff was friendly and attentive. During our recent visit, the temperatures dropped into the 30s at night, yet there was no heat from the central heating system due to what we were told was issues with a central boiler system The staff provided an in-room electric baseboard heating unit to offset this problem. Another issue to be aware of is that this hotel has limited food options and no restaurant that is part of the facility and no breakfast is included. The television service and selection of channels is very limited and is a poor option for any modern hotel in the Washington area.  While the bathroom fixtures are somewhat updated, they are rather pedestrian, with the exception of the oversized rainhead shower fixture - making showering an enjoyable experience. The facilities seemed to be in the mid-range as far as conservation and sustainability is concerned. Good use of energy conserving light fixtures and some plumbing fixtures while missing out on some low flow fixtures opportunities. All-in-all a good experience for a week long visit, but not sure I would stay there on my next visit."

        "review_text": "We decided to stay at the Luana because of the great reviews on trip advisor and also because it was priced relatively well for being right on the Waikiki strip.Pros:Location-easy walk to the beach, catching a sunrise/sunset is only a 5 minute walk, walking to the heart of Waikiki is only but another 5 minutes as it's located right across from Tony Roma's near the beginning of the stripSize of rooms: very spacious, there's a sitting area, balcony, kitchenette, fridge, everything that you could need for a tropical vacayNice free amenities as part of their resort fee: bike rentals, boogie boards, beach chairs, beach towelsPool is cute, not too crowded, (but no music/ambiance/not trendy) If you want to get a tan, read a book, it's still nice though, seemed pretty mellow when I was there. I didn't test the water temp because it was quite windy the day I was sun bathing.Cons:Ambiance-this is not a romantic hotel by any means. Most of the people staying here are significantly older and/or international families, If you are looking for a sexy vibe for your hotel, this is not itParking-valet only option at $35 is pretty steep especially given that this is not a luxury hotelTips:Ask for a higher floor so you don't hear the noise from the strip. Even on the 16th floor (their highest) my husband still heard some people fighting at 4am that woke him up!"

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Green Tortoise a few years ago and had an awesome experience. I\u2019ve since recommended it to lots of friends and family and they have all stayed. So when I had two nights in SF I straight away booked here again.We had a rough day and our two flights were delayed and we arrived at the hostel just after 2am (I had emailed the staff to let them know in advance) we arrived to the hostel and got our bags inside and my partner waited at the bottom of the stairs as I went to check in.As soon as I got to the top of the stairs I was yelled at by the receptionist \u201cdon\u2019t kick our doors\u201d....I was baffled and told her I hadn\u2019t done anything to the door other then bump it with my large suitcase. Which she snapped back \u201cyou kicked it, I watched you!\u201d.We were off to a great start and it only got worse.The receptionist VELL was rude, condescending, and incredibly unwelcoming. She snapped at me for asking her legitimate questions and gave sarcastic remarks. At this point my partner (who was down the bottom of the stairs) heard the way she was speaking to me and came up. He was also greeted with the same foul attitude. After snapping at us and taking my payment she said \u201croom 36, go right, left, right\u201d and threw the keys on the counter. No explanation of the facilities or perks this hostel offers.Then the following morning we were leaving early (5am) and the same staff member was sitting at the desk...scowling at us as we walked past, not so much as a smile or hello.We have been traveling all over the States and Canada for 12 weeks and this is the WORST customer service, hands down, we\u2019ve ever encountered.Vell - you are in the wrong line of work and the Green Tortoise should be ashamed to have someone like that on their otherwise great & friendly team.We stayed in a private room, it\u2019s was on the 3rd floor and was adequate. Bed was not the greatest but did the job. The bathrooms are great and they even offer shampoo/conditioner/soap.We didn\u2019t eat at the breakfasts as our schedule didn\u2019t allow but in my past stay it was great.Overall, the Hostel is cool & in a great location but our stay was completely ruined by the attitude of one staff member...and it ruined our time enough for us not to want to return."

This is a large conference type hotel in a great location  in walking distance to many many things like Chinatown.  We were put in a suite because the hotel was full, which was nice, but I didn't find the Murphy Bed particularly comfortable.  Also, we had a bar sink in the room that dripped constantly.  Annoying anytime but especially in a state with drought.  I reported it, but it never seemed to get repaired.  Staff were OK, nothing to write home about.  Truth be told, if I weren't at a conference, I'd have gone somewhere else."

This is one of many reviews for hotels in the area.I have stayed at the Park Hyatt twice now. I have been upgraded to a junior suite both times. The staff is always friendly and helpful.As a former DC resident I know for a fact Blue Duck Tavern is one of the best hotel restaurant in town, most definitely the best bone marrow. I have ever tasted.The salt water pool under a skylight is nice and relaxing. The hot tub and fitness center is five star as expected.The Le Labo toiletries, plush robe, rain shower head and soaking tub are much appreciated.I cannot say enough lovely thing about this hotel. Definitely the best out of the three on the block.My second time checking in, the front desk person mentioned an amenity is provided as I am a Hyatt member, but I didn't see anything in the room though. But that's nothing, the quality of the stay make up for it.It's to a point I know the description for it on Hotwire, and I try to get the Park Hyatt whenever I can.Definitely worth the money, I would be happy to pay my own way to stay there when i am in DC for leisure"

Apparently the auto function had malfunction during my stay in the hotel~ toiletries are top up every single dayLocation :~ situated in the central of BKK within Pratunam area, where one can walk around to experience the night market and the street vendors. Food and clothing etc etc - plentiful to look around. Shopping mall within walking distanceFood :~ lots of varieties for the complimentary breakfast buffet, however the queue can be very long at times~ I enjoyed the *in room* breakfast experienceServices :~ Excellent service throughout the whole day, reception counter staff, housekeeping staff, breakfast crew etc. I would say that all the staff that I met along the way are very polite and courteous. We are being greeted with smiles and greetings whenever we encounter any of the hotel staff including the security staff~ I am very touched for the personalised welcome card which was placed in the room. This simple gesture brings a very warm feeling to this heart of mine"

We also had dinner on the rooftop1 evening, Thai dishes,  which exceeded our expectations for a hotel and at a reasonable price. The rooftop bar was relaxing and when lit up in the evening provided an ideal setting.If requesting a complimentary Tuk-Tuk from the hotel make sure to wait for 1 with the hotel's name on the front as we found that there are unscrupulous Tuk-Tuk drivers who when asked will claim they are from the hotel only to ask for a fare en-route!"

The same man came back a second time banging on the door again waking the kids. I called front desk, all they did was send someone to see if there\u2019s a man up here, which there was and we heard nothing from them. No apology! When I complained I was told to call back in 3 mins because the hotel phone wasn\u2019t working in my room so she couldn\u2019t get hold of me... it\u2019s their phone not working I was the one ringing around, no one came up to check we were ok with the attempted robbing from this junky let in off the street, no concern for our safety! I was in tears upset we had to wake our kids and take them into the cold at 1am in the morning and worried we would need to sleep in the car should we be unable to find something, it really is a disgusting place!"

        "review_text": "We stayed at the Stanton the second week of May 2016 and found the hotel to be a great value, with more than adequate amenities for the price. It's right on the beach, but not so close to the pool area to be a distraction. We found all the hotel staff to be courteous, polite, and accommodating. In particular, Richard did a great job taking care of our needs at the pool. He was always attending to the needs of others, whether it was moving chairs or umbrellas or just engaging in friendly conversation. Meliena took care of our beverage needs at the pool with a smile and great service as well.I really cannot say enough about the hotel staff. Everyone was great.Our goals focused on relaxation and dining and we experienced only minor disappointment in this regard. As DC residents, we are accustomed to walking around town every day, so we walked to most of the restaurants and bars we experienced. Of note is Fish Called Avalon at the 700 block of Ocean Drive. A little pricey, but well worth it. Great food and service. And a front-row view of the spectacle that is Ocean Drive -- snake charmers, fashionistas of all sorts, exotic cars, and other human spectacles one would normally not experience (some PG-13) in other locales. Another favorite was Cibo Wine Bar at the south end of Ocean Drive. Great selection of wine, including Super Tuscans, and perhaps the best Tiramisu I've ever had. Rolando and Marco are two of the best bartenders anywhere.Although we saw many families with small children, South Beach can be a little PG-13 to NC-17 at times.Our stay lasted 5 nights, but it won't be the last. We'll definitely be back."

        "review_text": "Check in was busy with no executive line.  Was provided upgrade in recognition of Platinum status.  This was Easter week and there were more children in the hotel than I've ever experienced at a JW.  Consequently it was noisy.  Timing is not the hotel's fault, but the \"fit\" of the room doors which can allow or prevent noise is within the hotel's control.  Light around all sides of the room door = noise.  The executive lounge is under construction, but the hotel provided a first floor option and the food choices were good (1000 points compensation for lack of SAT availability).  Food/drink choices at the hotel are limited with the primary restaurant not open until 4; service from the bartender at 1331 was average.  The gym was good.  I've stayed at the Willard and the Courtyard and now the JW (yes a wide range); if Congress is not in session and the price is right, this is a good option for a downtown location.  Otherwise may not be worth the premium price; if you are simply looking for a quiet room in a good location with a good gym and acceptable food the Courtyard is as good a choice."

It was a family trip but this is a very romantic hotel if that's what you need.We had an issue with the cleanliness of the room to start, staff fixed the issue very quickly.Pet friendly hotel, pool and work-out room.We needed an extra bed, they got us in a room that fit that and we still had space to move.My only is issue is the mini fridge. I understand the need for a mini bar, but I'd like a mini fridge and a coffee maker in the room. We take all the items out of the mini frig/bar to make room for our needs. Maybe have that option available."

        "review_text": "We stayed here for one night on the last night of our honeymoon after a week in Maui staying in lovely small guesthouses. We thought a night in a luxury resort would be a special treat to end the trip. It was just one bad experience after the other and I feel totally ripped off. Maybe I am just not used to the resort lifestyle and was ignorant of what happens in this sort of hotel. I felt bewildered at no information given or any sort of hospitality. It\u2019s like you had to have been there before to know what to do. The manager did take the drinks we had off the bill to apologise, and also the *amenity fee* for the one dip in the pool (which we didn\u2019t realise we had to pay extra for)...On check in, the person greeting us hardly made any eye contact and it was really unwelcoming. I\u2019ve wanted to come to Honolulu and Hawaii for years! It was so rude. The signage was really bad and some signage is just in Japanese with no English at all so wayfinding was really difficult and there was no information in the room about where to go or what time things open/close. Nobody told us about breakfast options, we had to look on the website. We got to our room and yes the bed was a big king size and very comfy. The only good thing. There was a partial view of the ocean in our \u2018Ocean View\u2019 room and the bathroom was so basic. Like a Travelodge with an electronic toilet (which didn\u2019t work). Not to mention scolding myself on the shower when I went to turn it off because there was no signage at all and I must have flipped it the wrong way. There were no bath robes, so you have to walk across the lobby to the other tower of the hotel to get to the pool with no robe or fully clothed. I thought there\u2019d be a discreet way to get there without walking past front desk in your costume! I wanted to have a dip in the infinity pool the morning before we had to check out. After trying to find out what time the pool opens (not on the website, no signage on the room floors or elevator, nobody answers at concierge desk) Only to find an aqua fit class with pumping music at 8:30am.It was just so not what we were expecting. Not relaxing luxurious and enjoyable at all. I think they rest on the laurels of the location...I felt like a second class guest and it was not a nice ending to our honeymoon. We didn\u2019t stay for breakfast which was \u20ac30 each for continental buffet (with no view).On the other hand, Marimoto restaurant was fantastic and we had great customer service there, and great food."

Our check-in was smooth and spectacular. We were actually misbooked and treated poorly at another hotel a half mile from this one. One call and one uber ride later, we were in the Hampton lobby, and greeted with amazing service and genuinely nice staff. So nice in fact that I insisted they give me their names so that I could single them out. They were, whom I have fondly come to know as the three M's,Marcus, Monica and Matt. Matt was also kind enough to steer us to an amazing \"locals\" restaurant, Hub 51, that delivered as expected. One last thing before I bore you, I left this morning to Rockford, about an hour and a half away, returned four hours later to discover that I completely forgot to close my safe. Our expensive jewelry, medication and otherr valuables were left completely undisturbed. That is a rare quality my friends. I highly recommen this hotel!!!"

        "review_text": "I have to say I have never been in a hotel with such proximity to a lot of tourist destinations. The Golden Gate, Golden Gate Park, Union Square, The Bay Bridge, Castro, and even China Town! The hotel has a lot of amazing array rooms, and the one I stayed in was very quiet and clean (room 1615). The restaurant was amazing, they have a choice of letting you pick off the menu or you could serve yourself at the buffet. You could request special orders to the chef if you go with the buffet option like Belgian Waffles or Omelets. Even though the hotel is amazing the parking system is strange, but durable. Once you pull up from Mason street the valet guys take the car pretty fast. They will give you a card where you have to text 10 minutes in before you go out so they can go fetch the car. Overall the Hotel was amazing! I'm definitely staying here for my next visit!"

The room Andrew gave us by far our best room ever. Very clean, classy bathroom, beds are comfortable. Location is good. Restaurants, shopping centers are just walking distance.

        "review_text": "This is a pretty nice hotel. What attracted me to it was the no resort fee policy. This saves a lot of money as Vegas hotels generally charge $20-45 a night resort fee.On arrival I asked for a high up room, as someone with a chronic illness sleep is important to me and having stayed on Fremont before I know how noisy it is. The staff weren't able to provide me with a room above the 4th floor in the north tower on the first night, however in fairness to the hotel, I was offered a comp upgrade to the south tower, I declined this and waited until after the weekend to switch rooms as the south tower rooms don't have tubs and this is important to me.I had heard that there was a reward for not having housekeeping (slot play or food discount), I asked the staff about this and they didn't seem to know any more than I did and I couldn't understand how it worked as it wasn't explained to me so I gave up on my plans to take advantage of this offer.The wifi is great, especially considering it's free.The pool at Binions (former Mint site) across the street is open to 4 queens guests and it's basic but nice, you can also take your own drinks etc. The views from the pool are great.We had a couple of  poor experiences at Magnolias restaurant in the casino (see separate review) so won't be dining at 4 Queens again, they treat you like trash in there.The rooms are nice, nicer than I expected actually, especially in the older tower. The old school feel of the place overall is nice and the view from my room was great.The elevator is noisy and this did bother me in the night.Overall for the price I was happy with my stay and will probably stay again."

It is a short walk to the Strip itself, and the fact that it is off the Strip and doesn't have a game floor can make it more appealing to those who are traveling with a child/children (like us.)  Each time we've stayed here it is because of the large rooms and the fact they can accommodate large groups. This time it was us (a family of three) and our friends and their young child; six all together. The suite was spacious, well appointed and very clean and quiet. Beds were comfortable and the kitchenette and in room laundry facility was great to have. The pool areas of the hotel (there are two) are wonderful and family friendly. The hotel shop accommodates basic needs and also sells coffee and gelato. Cannot fault this hotel."

The Talbott is in a great location as it is 2 blocks from infamous Michigan Avenue that has vast shops, boutiques, and delicious restaurants to dine in. There were 4 of us ladies on an annual Girl's Trip and we had 2 rooms--which were a very nice size. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathrooms were equipped with everything we needed. We enjoyed dining outside in the restaurant as the staff/personnel/concierge were awesome! It was a very enjoyable and refreshing experience.  Dwayne was particularly helpful as he not only assisted us with our luggage, but he was so very attentive and helpful with things to do, excellent restaurant suggestions, shows to see, transportation, directions...anything we needed. Overall, this hotel has amazing charm and wonderful personnel. Warm, friendly, and amazing service is what you will get if you stay at The Talbott. Looking forward to my next visit in the Windy City!"

Friendly and helpful front desk / concierge staff. Comfortable, spacious clean room on the Landmark Tower, with wifi. Shuttle to/from from SFO Airport at $34 for 2 persons (must have exact change /otherwise the remaining will be tips for driver). Taxi fare to Golden Gate Park at $19 and Sausalito at $52. Hotel concierge will suggest Big Bus Hop On & Off tour, but there are few options available on the street just opposite hotel at Union Square (next Empurio Rulli Cafe). Hotel is having staffing issue, used external temporary staff for many jobs. Their staff are on strike, disrupting public peace causing public nuisance outside the hotel now. Extreme noise pollution (can be heard on 7th floor) from 6.30am - 11pm daily, unsure how long this going to continue. No room make up service. Limited staff, long queue expected during check in/out. Hotel concierge recommended external doctor for consultation at few thousand dollars for some injury dressing, insane to hire such services. The security officers assisted with needful first aid amenities. Pleasant stay in San Francisco."

Customer service was excellent thanks to Abby who checked us in. Walking in from an all day meeting to the sweet smelling lobby and greeted by a friendly face set the tone for our stay. There is a very cool outdoor terrace off the lobby bar and a sky walk to one of the malls and steps away from the Mag Mile. Rooms were spacious and had the largest TVs I've seen in a hotel. This is a SPG property and it shows very well. My bathroom came with a tub and separate shower. Heavenly bed didn't let me down. Luckily, we were traveling on business, but the room was high compared to other experiences I've had in similar hotels. Good tip is to check on conferences occurring in the city and try to avoid those times for the best rates and availability."

I was there for almost a week with my mother, and we both had a double bed. The room was cleaned up everyday!"

Not the usual Sofitel experience so be careful if you have high expectations.- The location is great for exploring Chicago.- The lobby is modern, dark and moody and smells great!- Check-in was quick but nothing personal.- Hotel corridors are bright and colorful - not really my thing.- Room was average but clean. Definitely not luxury and bed was incredibly soft.- They did have Lanvin toiletries - kudos!Wouldn't recommend or stay here again. There are better places in Chicago... Virgin Hotel, Peninsula."

The rooms are spacious and very well appointed. There is nothing to ask for, it is somehow anticipated before you even know you needed. The staff really makes this place, all are courteous and willing to assist you with whatever you need. I really see no need to stay anywhere else when visiting the Washington DC area. We spent Thanksgiving here as a family and I want this to be our annual tradition, let Plume do the cooking and enjoy family."

        "review_text": "I came here for a week celebrating a cousins birthday. I reserved a 1 bedroom with kitchenette which had a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, plates and utensils as well as a sofa bed. Check-in was done quickly. They gave us a room in tower 5, 10th floor. We were fairly close to the \"adult only\" hot tub (opened 24 hours).This is a different experience than staying on strip. You must either drive, take a taxi or take their complimentary shuttle to the strip. It's about a 15-20 minute drive depending on traffic. They also offer bus rides to Fremont Street and day trips to Red Rock Canyon. When we tried to take one to Fremont St, the tickets were already reserved for that day (we did not know there was a restricted amount, so that caught us by surprise).There is a Denny's on site for a reasonable breakfast option. $4 breakfast! That's even cheaper than Mickey D's! The other restaurant we didn't try, but one of our gals won $100 at their slot machine (they have 2 machines and video poker at the counter).We did not have anyone trying to sell us a time share. There was a flier under our door the second to the last night to call for presentation. We did not and no pressure was given for any presentations. Maybe because all of us gals were traveling solo.The adult hot tub was big and it was great that it was opened 24 hours. The lazy river was open as well but it was chilly out,  although it is heated.We felt really comfortable and safe at this place. It's really great if you have kiddos. They have activities for them and movie night. There is a casino about 5 minutes away if getting to the strip is not desired (Silverton). That casino has a mermaid bar where mermaids swim a few times a day. That was pretty cool.All in all it was a pretty good stay and I would consider this resort again"

        "review_text": "We wanted a hotel close to Grant Park and this hotel has a good location. Rooms are not large, but they are nice, clean, and comfortable. Nice lobby and friendly staff. My complaints were the noise - my room was located on the side of the hotel where there are 2 alleys below so any noise reverberates. 5:00 am came and garbage trucks were down in the alley banging around dumpsters for more than an hour. That was fun. The rooms themselves aren't particularly quiet, you can easily hear any noise out in the hallway. Trying to pull up in front of the hotel for valet parking is very difficult, lots of traffic and very little open space to pull up to the curbside valet area. I was also incorrectly charged twice for valet parking - haven't checked out yet to know if that will be an issue. If you want a place downtown that is reasonably priced, this hotel would be fine, as long as you don't mind some noise. Me personally, next time I'd stay further out from downtown and just take a cab into the downtown area."

        "review_text": "We come here every year for a conference held across the street at the Convention Center. We've seen changes over the years, most for the good, and we keep coming back because of the personal service we get. They renovated a few years ago and I like the room enhancements, especially the fridge in every room. I do miss the excellent Asian restaurant that was replaced by more lobby space and a Starbucks.There is a nice executive club room for elite level guests (free breakfast and snacks), and the staff there is very accommodating. It's generally closed on weekends but this time they gave us a voucher for breakfast. Unfortunately FourvSquare is closed for renovations and there was not enough space in the Presidents Sports  Lounge, so there was a very long wait, the opposite of what you want in the club lounge. It defeated the purpose of the voucher but I'm sure this will be fixed next year.Whenever I have a problem anywhere in the hotel, it is generally resolved quickly and some staff go above and beyond, this time literally running to get needed items and storing my medication in their personal fridge when my ice packs didn't freeze.There is now a new (and more expensive) hotel even nearer to the convention center with an underground tunnel to avoid inclement weather--the Marriott Marquis. I've heard it still has kinks to work out but it is already stealing the Renaissance clientele, so Renaissance staff is bending over backwards to please.It remains to be seen how it will all work out, but for now, I'm sticking with the Renaissance."

        "review_text": "I have just returned from staying in the Hotel Zephyr. It has very modern decor and generally clean overall - That said, the bed sheets had been laundered but blood stains were still clearly visible. The hotel does have a nice outside area and a well-stocked games room. On the down side, I turned up at 3pm as agreed, but was told the room would not be available until 4pm. The reception staff were not particularly helpful, but I expect this was due to the very large volume of short-stay guests, rather than any malice. My only surprise was the additional $21 Urban Facility Fee/taxes, which were in addition to the normal $36 hotel taxes, taking the total cost to \u00a3218 a night from the advertised \u00a3170. I thought this was very expensive for the small size of the room. My advice would be not to stay in Fisherman's Wharf, but find a nice hotel in the  city, where costs can be considerably cheaper for a similar hotel; you can also spend the savings you have made on eating out and entertainment. You probably know that San Francisco has an excellent public transport system, so travelling around is really easy wherever you stay."

Although there weren't any restaurants close to the hotel, the food in the hotel (room service) was delicious and it was about a ten minute walk from a variety of restaurants.Had breakfast in the hotel, for our first few days it was Memorial Weekend so only a buffet breakfast was on offer. Choice was excellent and food was delicious. Loved that our waiter greeted us by name. Had room service twice during our time here and service was out of this world. When the food was delivered, it was set up for us just like in a restaurant. Service was fast and friendly.Staff were friendly and helpful especially the valet and bell hop on the front door.Enjoyed the little notes left by the turn down service and the slippers at the side of the bed. Only thing missing for me was that there was no coffee machine in the room.Will definitely look out for other Mandarin hotels in the future."

I got a gift certificate from my friends at the restaurant inside the hotel - MAC 24/7. The food was great (server was not the friendliest but did come and fill our drinks). The hotel staff was very friendly. The hotel is centrally located and is within walking distance of the beach, shopping centers, and other local restaurants. I would definitely recommend this hotel!"

        "review_text": "We stayed here for two nights.  We greatly enjoyed the common areas of the hotel (though there is not a large general area to just lounge).  The breakfast buffet was delicious!  The tea room is very interesting with a fantastic tea selection of some very rare teas.  Service at the hotel was 5 *.  Now for the rooms, I was not that impressed.  We stayed in a junior suite.  I found the furniture to be lacking.  While some looks contemporary, some just reminded me of IKEA furniture in style and quality.  Did not look 5* to me at all.  More like a fancy holiday inn.  Some pieces of furniture were nice reminding me of shaker style furniture.  The bed was however sublime and very comfy.  Also, the bathroom was very beautiful. Would have liked for the water closet to be separated from rest of bathroom by door for privacy.  The tub was ice, but small.  Unable to stretch out and I am average size person.  Did not care for the pool.  There is a large box for toys so you can gather what this means.  Very child friendly, but not good for relaxation. The pool was quite basic in design.  Again, more like a holiday inn.  No sauna and steam rooms which surprised me given the star rating of this hotel."

Same for the next night, when we had tickets to a Broadway Play, we were able to hop on the train and get to midtown quickly.The hotel is on Ann St., and this particular block is a little dingy, but the neighborhood is just fine.Our room was relatively small, with a king-sized bed, and a little bit of a view. It's a view of other high-rises, and nothing extraordinary, but better than others I've had in NYC. No bathtub in the room, but a nice fully tiled shower.There is no restaurant in the hotel, but room service is available from a nearby service (which we did not use.) The lobby is well stocked with snacks and beverages for sale, and there is an in-house bar/lounge and outdoor patio--all of which is inviting and fun.The room rate was $161 per night, which is quite reasonable for NYC. The front desk personnel were helpful and pleasant.We brought a car and while the hotel doesn't have parking, there is a garage about half a block away which is convenient and cost $66 per night. I recommend the Aloft Manhattan Downtown Financial District hotel, and I would stay there again."

We came in from Midway and it was only about a 20 minute cab ride.  The check in went smooth and the front desk was helpful and friendly.  Even the guys that get your luggage have a smile on their faces and actually want to be helpful with information.We upgraded to a suite, which was plenty big enough, so we really don't know what the regular room was like.  There are no closets, but there is some hanging space and drawers.  We had two queen beds in our suite and we just used one to lay our clothes out on.  The room was quite with a city view from the living area.They brought us two thermos of coffee every morning at a time that we specified at no cost, yes free.  There was also a bakery downstairs with very reasonable prices.  People would go down there in their robes (provided) and order.  They also do a knock and drop, so if you want it delivered no problem.Other reviewers have mentioned how conveniently located the hotel is and they are right on the money with that.  There are numerous restaurants all around the hotel.  There is also a grocery store very nearby (as we had a small refrigerator and a microwave in out room).Again, I hate to let the cat out of the bag, but this place will be on our return list for sure.  By the way there was a guitar in our room for us to play on, unfortunately, neither of us could play but that didn't stop us from trying, lol."

The only thing that could have made this better would have been glimpsing the president, but he was in Bedminster all weekend. From the gorgeous and upscale bar and lounge and reception area, to the absolutely plush and exquisite guest suites, this hotel is a stunner.  I have never experienced such luxury. The staff anticipates your every need. Pricy, but in this prime, D.C. neighborhood, you expect it. We cannot wait to return."

I liked everything! Interior, convenience, location .. perfect! Also I must mention the people - Leila and Kevin were very friendly and ready to help with any questions (e.g. \"where to buy another suitcase\" - it was July and sales :) or \"where is the best bar overlooking the night city \") I am extremely grateful !! Another of the big advantages is a restaurant with an excellent menu and wine list, and a bakery and pastry shop on the ground floor. God, this croissant with almonds and raspberries, I will remember, it seems every day! All in all, I fully recommend this hotel !! Guys, thanks for doing your job at this level! If I come to New York, I\u2019ll definitely choose only Evelyn !!! xxx"

        "review_text": "My husband and I stayed at the Angler's on a recent visit to Miami for his birthday.  The hotel went above and beyond to make this an incredibly special stay for us.  Upon checkin we found they had upgraded us to Manor Villa with a patio & spa...it was an incredible space.  To top that, we were welcomed with balloons, champagne and cookies, a personalized note from the staff and a big bowl of Florida oranges!  The staff here took such care to make us feel welcomed, it was tremendously appreciated!We ventured to the living room area for wine hour and had a great time chatting with the restaurant manager and other guests.  The intimate space was perfect for mingling or playing games...fun games, like Uno and Connect 4.  After wine hour we spent some time at the pool, which is small but so refreshing and relaxing.Later in the evening we dined at the restaurant and the food was excellent, the service was awesome and we enjoyed dining alfresco.  We were there on a quiet evening and with only a few other tables, we enjoyed the cozy, intimate atmosphere.Everything about our stay at the Angler's was better than we could have ever imagined and we actually considered changing our flights the next day in order to stay another day or two!  While we couldn't make that work, we will most certainly return to the Angler's for our next visit to Miami Beach."

The Hotel is conveniently located just off of Fremont Street at the center of Old Vegas... The Restaurant is very good, the drinks are solid, the casino is small and quaint with all the gambling options one needs... The Sports Book was A M A Z I N G... so helpful and so accomodating over our 4 days of College Basketball Madness!!! The desk service upon check in was my ONLY complaint... I used \"the sandwich\" to get an upgrade... she took my $50 and put me in a room that was worse than all my buddies who didn't try the trick!!! After seeing my view of the parking ramp structure, I went down and asked for an upgraded room... she moved me to the same room 1 floor higher... Long Story short - I ended up in my original room with a view of the pool and got my $50 back - but not after being treated quite rudely... NONETHELESS - it was a great stay and we are going back again this year!!!"

The room was out of this world, it came with personal Starbucks coffee making facilities, slippers, bath robes, water, fresh fruit and a beautiful view of the neighbouring golf course and mountains. The hotel has its own private spa, shops, dolphin lagoon, turtle and ray lagoons, private beach and is well known for having many high profile celebrity guests. They have a hall of fame with photos of all celeb & royal visitors......its safe to say we felt out of place haha. But we were treated no different. Our room included breakfast, which was the best buffet breakfast i think we have ever had anywhere. They also have valet parking and free shuttle services & pick ups to certain places in and around Waikiki. Every evening when we came to our room our bed was freshly turned down, with chocolates on the pillow and fresh water. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. One day I hope we can visit again soon, I really miss this place, the people were so friendly and it was pure heaven. Always greated with a warm and friendly Aloha and Mahalo."

It is a 10 mins walk from the Capitol buildings and 15 from the nearest Smithsonian. My only concern would be that the wine list in the restaurant was extortionate, but we were suffering from exchange rate shock so others may find it less so. I think it may have been oriented with guests on expense accounts!Which brings me to mention that while it is ideal for romantic trip away, it also has all the essentials that a business traveller would be looking for, which is my normal mode of travel."

This hotel used to be the home of the Chicago Motor Club which opened in 1928, so there is an original 29 foot wide road map on the wall near the elevator and a 1928 Model A on the mezzanine level for you to admire while eating breakfast or just chilling in the comfy lobby seating. The hotel is just a few blocks from Magnificent Mile and the Riverwalk. The standard room was a decent size, bed was comfy and service was excellent. A bit pricey though for my mid week stay."

It's so different than most in the same price range.  Its got a vibe that you can feel as you take the escalator from the street level to the lobby.  The lobby is a smaller open air design that flows right into the bar and restaurant as well as pool.  Its a few blocks off the beach which is walkable or you can take a free bike, which I highly recommend.  At night, the bar makes great drinks, several craft beers on draft and their food menu is simple but outstanding.  Try the spicy edamame.  I've run into so many international travelers that stop down for a drink and listen to the live music.  I guess they recruit locals that can sing well which also attracts people to the bar.  Rooms are very cool and I like the pool area.  Its not on the beach so don't think of it as a beach resort.  I've stayed at the Marriott Waikiki and I'd rather stay at the Laylow."

        "review_text": "Lots of restaurants and amenities within walking distance of this hotel. The Metro station is a quick walk away. Rooms are nice - if a bit small. For what I paid ($125 Sun $242 each of the next 2 nights) I expected a better breakfast, a more consistent front desk experience and a better greeting from valet when I first pulled up on 10/29. Luckily for me, because valet was nowhere to be found a very nice staff member alerted me to where I could park on the street. For free. For all three nights. I should have taken advantage of a Travelzoo offer that landed in my email the day before my trip for $89/night plus free valet at the Hampton Inn NOMA Union Station property (avail through Feb 2018, check it out) but wanted to experience the Navy Yard vibe. Maybe worth it in warmer weather or if I were in town for a Nationals baseball game, but not otherwise. Oh ... photo is from room 1009. Construction that began at 6 a.m. each weekday morning. You have been warned ..."

A special thanks to Eddie , who took great care of us effortlessly and 100%! We asked for a tea pot for our room and it was delivered and we used the bike service and rode over the GG bridegroom for free!. The Monaco changers our room per our request after the first night, happily! I just cannot say enough positive about this hotel and its staff! Our house keeper asked to change the sheets after the  third night, we had snugly robes to relaxin after a cold day of play and a free wine hour every night by the fire! Our trip just would not have been the same without the wonderful hospitality of this hotel! Thank you thank you! An A+ from me!! Oh yes location location location ! A+!"

        "review_text": "I did a lot of research before booking a place in Bangkok. I wanted a nice pool, roof top bar, comfy bed and something close to the action but I didn't want to pay $250USD a night. Marriott ticked all the boxes and confirmed that I made the right decision for us.Our room was very comfortable, yes a little on the small side but this wasn't an issue. The bed was very nice.Breakfast was awesome. Marriot, you have the best chocolate donuts around!But seriously they did have quality bread products.The pool was nice, never too packed.We only went up to the rooftop bar once. The views were very nice but the drinks were pricy as expected.The location is okay in that is very close to the sky train so you can get everywhere easily. But as far as bars/restaurants and shopping within walking distance there is really nothing around.If I have to fault this place at all it is with these minor issues:1) The pool bar ran out of gin and vodka at 2pm in the afternoon ???!!!2) the Steak restaurant was not a good value. My steak was not the best cut and it was super pricy ($40USD)Other than those minor issues I would totally recommend this hotel."

This first room we checked in to the shower was not working and the toilet was broken. The second room was part of the presidential suite and the walls are so thin you can hear the neighbors talk. The swimming pool was dirty with a lot of broken stones and the chairs were broken as well. Last but not least the breakfast for $23 is a simple rip off. The Westin in Seattle is not worth the price and is in desperate need of a total refit."

        "review_text": "This hotel is clean and modern but as older (60s) guests it is not one I would recommend. The beds are on low platforms which could be difficult to maneuver and the poolside lounge chairs are also very low and not well padded. Ask for a room away from elevator to avoid that noise. The hotels location was central to explore the city and there was a walkway to beach,  pool was adequate and poolside food/beverage service was very good. The restaurant poolside served some very good food, no complaints there. Staff were all helpful and attentive. We would not recommend this to older quests but with the nightlife it might be a good place for the younger crowd. Keep in mind fireworks on Friday evening... They were delightful."

The stench of deodorizer in the hallways was overwhelming. We were so sad as the employees were so nice and we had so many fond memories here but I guess all good things come to an end. Looks like we will have to find a new place to stay."

        "review_text": "Let me start off that SF has gotten crazy with its prices for hotel rooms and the Omni is great for the market price. The customer service was incredible at all levels: house cleaning, front desk, bell men, and valet shined. The hotel doesn't have a gift shop to get forgotten toiletries but the front desk had free items behind the counter in case you forgot your tooth brush which happened in our case. They gave us free bottles of water as well which was nice. My only knock against the hotel was that they didn't have free wifi in the room. They wanted to charge an additional $15. At $375 a night for the cheaper rooms this should be part of your stay and not additional charge. Overall, great location & super hospitality."

        "review_text": "We stayed at the Mandarin for 4 nights. The property is exquisite. The service is 5 star. The service is accessible without being overbearing. Everyone that we met truly takes pride in their work.When we arrived we were welcomed by affable ambassadors.  We were greeted by pleasant and helpful valet, the door persons and bell people that swooped in right away. There was not a second wait. They were assiduous without attitude or a sweat. We were given complimentary ice cold bottled water when we arrived. It was like arriving in Shangri-La. Enchanting!Our son received a complimentary beautiful, plush and luscious stuffed Mandarin panda bear.  What a tasteful touch!  Everything that Mandarin does is so luxurious, upscale and refined.We checked into the property with Hannah at the front desk. The luxury is just oozing out of the front desk experience from the gorgeous binder that the room agreement to the warm towels and tea that is offered. Hannah escorted us to the elevator. The bell-person was already ahead of us to our room.Hannah is a saint. I was so high maintenance (more than usual). I am even annoyed with myself and I can't imagine how she was able to maintain such grace and composure. We decided to change our reservations to the AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts (when we originally reserved with Mandarin directly). Poor Hannah had to navigate through a sea of hoops for us. I admire her patience. I personally do not have that composure. Hannah is an example of serenity and competence.The concierge, Phil is such a sweetheart. I feel like I met \"Mr. Smith goes to Washington\" in real life. He is so earnest like James Stewart. We adore him. He was so sweet with our son. Phil went out of his way to make sure that we had good vegan options in town.The above mentioned staff are not condescending, patronizing, arrogant, scornful, supercilious towards guests (particularly our unconventional family).We had a renovated room. The renovations in the room are delicious. The tasteful ivory/egg shell is complemented with muted bluish green fabric curtains. My only note with the design is the head board. I hope they decide to change the headboard to a lovely ivory fabric like the couches or the lounge chair. They could even use the fabrics of the curtains or the blue from the desk chair.The bathroom design is perfection.  The marble is divine. The separate shower and the shower. The products are the tasteful Atelier Cologne. I recommend that the property have refillable wall mounted bottles of product (to cut back on waste of all those small plastic bottles). If people prefer the small plastic bottles, there could be some available at the front desk or through housekeeping. I think my husband would have appreciated a television in the mirror (typically seen in St. Regis properties) but I don't mind and I can see how that is garish. The terry robes are comfortable and soothing when exiting the bathroom. Our son doesn't like taking baths. I tried to give him a shower with the removable shower head in the bathroom. The temperature could not go down enough for his liking (he likes it pretty cold-ish warm). I found a work around. We put him in the bath but used the removable shower head in the bath (there is one near the faucet in the bath). He was pleased (and we were pleased that he was bathed and cleaned). There were several other products in the bathroom. There were a tooth brush, a razor, cotton swabs and cotton balls.Mini bar: We wish that we called ahead to have the contents removed. We figured out how to lock the refrigerator to prevent our 6 year old son from pulling out all the products.Turn down service: The turn down service was lovely with elegant touches like bookmarks on top of our books and cards with meditative subjects.Engineering: We had a couple minor issues with our newly renovated room that is natural. One was the stopper/drain in the sink and the other was that the air conditioning hit one side of the bed than the other. In both instances, the engineering department immediately swept in to fix the issues without hesitation.Spa and pool:Access to the spa: One of my favorite things about this Mandarin property is the access to the spa amenities for the guests. It is uncommon for a hotel to give access to the whirl pool / plunge pool and steam room in the locker rooms for guests. The tile mosaic next to the plunge pool is pure art. The amethyst steam room is heavenly with celestial ceiling. I felt like I was floating above the clouds. Pure decadent relaxation.The aroma is gorgeous and seductive. The color scheme is tasteful and warm in the lobby. The locker room area could use more flattering lighting in the locker area, perhaps better color paint on the walls. Maybe some seats with nice upholstery.  The extremely comfortable, elegant, lush, thick towels and robes are thick. The Quintessence scent used for the lotions, body wash, shampoo and conditioner in the spa is gorgeous. There is hair products and other women products accessible in the locker room. The entire spa staff (cleaning, front desk and therapists) were accommodating and angelic.I enjoyed reprieves/ escapes from my husband and son in the spa facilities. On the last day, I got an amazing massage. My masseuse was intuitive, skilled, strong and responsive to my body. This was not your typical fluffy hotel spa treatment, this was a real deal body work session. I would go back to DC just for this massage.On the first day, our son had a scare and struggle in the pool. Of course, I was distressed. I jumped into the pool with my clothes on practically. The spa attendant, Priscilla came out right away and called someone. Although there is no lifeguard on duty, the hotel was completely on top of it. Thank goodness, our son was okay. We received so much authentic, compassionate concern from so many staff (including Phil (the concierge) and Hannah).The restaurant: We are vegan. We are used to properties not being able to cater to our diets. Because of our Amex Fine Hotels/Resorts reservation, we were afforded free breakfast. We were able to substitute some of the buffet options for vegan options. We were in paradise. Our breakfast was healthy, luscious and fresh. Our server, Rene is the best. We requested him for the rest of our trip. He remembered exactly what we drank, the substitutions that we would want from the buffet and our family. He is an asset to the property. The rest of the restaurant staff were quick to clear our tables when they saw an empty plate. There was no shame in us taking a few apples from the buffet to munch on later. Everyone on staff was so supportive, pleasant and kind. The manager remembered us every day and made sure that everything was how we wanted. Children eat for free. How great is that!In room dining: The in room dining is supurb. Our son ate the kid's pasta every day practically. He wanted the gluten free penne pasta with marinara on the side (no parsley or cheese). He also eats sorbet (he is vegan). He was in heaven with the in room dining (especially when he received a slice of vegan chocolate cake for his birthday).Personal service: We felt that the staff knew us by the end of our trip which was such a gift to our son--it was his birthday. He did not want to leave. On the last day he said that he wants to move to the Mandarin. I had a headache. I went to the front desk and received a complimentary packet of tylenol. The Director of Front Office Operations, Katharina Berchtold and the Front Office Manager Carmen Richards are an asset to the property. They trouble shoot and handle customer service with the utmost respect and regard. Ms. Berchtold and Ms. Richards ought to hold trainings for other hotels on how to handle complaints in a humble manner. They work towards exceeding hotel guests expectations. I can only speak of the interpersonal skills of staff or crew that I mention in this review.One of the nicest moments here was when our son spoke to the Mandarin telephone operator on our first night. Our son asked if the hotel was haunted. The hotel operator was so sweet with him and explained that there are no ghosts or spirits in this hotel. I thought it was such a storybook moment. Very adorable.The facilities: The property and grounds are spotless. Our cleaning person for the room, Cheryl has got to be one of the most pleasant people that I have ever met. I just feel better about life whenever I am around her. She is genuine and authentic. She did a thorough job on our suite. The place is immaculate.There was complimentary \"Nirvana\" bottled water everywhere. I had a large stockpile in our room.The hotel stands as a beacon over the Potomac River. On the other hand, while the complaints about the location are real. Although the front of the location is inconvenient, generic, desolate, anonymous.. even barren. That being said, the property's luxury, opulence, grandeur, magnificence and splendor makes up for the location. The Mandarin's tranquility invalidates the concerns of the surrounding. Rather than the crowds along with the hustle and bustle of the Washington DC streets, the Mandarin sits on a peaceful perch high above (almost as if on clouds) in a haven from that noise, stress and tension of the urban environs. The Mandarin is an oasis without being suburban. The Mandarin is an escape without being too far. My husband enjoyed evening runs along the water front and in front of the lit monuments. Those experiences along with the views made up for the inconvenience. In addition, there are always taxis near the property, apps for cars, and the Metro is close by. We valeted our car and used it for a couple excursions to restaurants and record shopping on U street. We considered putting our car in a public parking garage nearby but we were happy with the safety of the valet and the amazing valet staff who are so quick and professional.**There is construction underway for new shops, restaurants and water access nearby.We travel as a family from Brooklyn to Washington DC at least 2x a year to go to all the museums. We enjoy strolling down the Mall to all the different museums. My husband insisted that we try the Mandarin this time since it is so convenient to the Mall and the Monuments. I am so grateful that I succumbed to his campaign. We used to stay at the Park Hyatt and we are converted to the Mandarin. We have reservations for the Ritz for New Years and we plan to change our reservations to the Mandarin. We are a thirty something Brooklyn couple with a young child. We can earnestly say that the property is a fabulous place for families (urban or suburban or international). I would also recommend it for business and conferences. I also saw several people holding casual meetings in the lobby lounge. Speaking of the lobby lounge, I had the most delicious breakfast tea, Assam Breakfast Tea by Jing. The server was so accommodating and was juggling many tables with joy.The Mandarin is the finest hotel in Washington DC because of it's serene environs, luxury property with delicate touches of refinement and most significantly the best staff in the city.We were swept up in a magicalWe are now loyal customers to the Mandarin and we will stay there for years to come.I always write these with my reviews*note for international travelers: it is customary to tip staff. These are the minimums. Of course more wealthy people ought to tip in the $20 range. We are lower middle class New Yorkers so this is what we tip: At least $5 for valet (both when I leave the car and when I pick up the car). At least $3 for door persons or staff who give directions or help out with something. It is customary for $2-3 per bag with bell persons. Housekeeping should get $5 per day plus more at check out. The per day tip is good because there can be different people cleaning the room for different days of the week. The restaurant is a minimum 20% with more on the last day. The front desk at check in is a min $20. Everyone should be tipped. Someone gives me a water would get $2 at least. Concierge gets $10 roughly. Spa gets at least 20%. with more if the services are impeccable. The spa cleaning staff gets at least $5 (including the people who replenish pool towels)"

        "review_text": "Let me start this review by saying I have stayed at other Autograph properties before coming here and came into this with certain expectations. That aside, the inside of the hotel is beautifully done although quite quaint. I did like how this property is a bit tucked away off Kuhio ave but yet smack dab in the middle of Waikiki; kind of gives it it's \"lawlow\" feel.We got a Deluxe Corner Suite and were given the corner of the hotel facing Kuhio ave and the parking garage next to the pool. The room itself is BEAUTIFUL. They really have done a wonderful job with these rooms compared to what this hotel used to be. If this hotel was somewhere tucked away on the beach and a little bigger, it would be HEAVEN. This room had a very comfortable king bed,  a queen daybed (essentially your couch), a little reading corner of sorts, and two balconies. The one thing that shocked me about this room was the bathroom. It was TINY and just standard shower, sink, and a toilet. Most properties would not have a \"Delux Corner Suite\" that's just got a standard hotel bathroom, let alone a tiny one.The Hideaway (the on-property restaurant and bar and cafe). This place is excellent. The food is amazing. Chicken Satay and Kalua pig egg rolls were some of our favorites. Even the service is great; very warm and welcoming but also on top of things. Bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable in their craft. Drinks were great. My parters favorite drink is a \"pain killer\" and she mentioned they were pretty darn good. BONUS: it's on their happy hour menu. They also have nightly music. We were only there a few days mid-week so we go the live music vibe. On Thursdays-Saturdays they have live DJ's. The woman who was singing while we were there was AMAZING. Hey voice was powerful, on key, and the song choices were perfect for the lowkey vibe of the hideaway. Overall, this part of the hotel is on point.The pool is...well... small... This part is SO hard to review because you can tell they really tried. I mean it looks quite beautiful for what/where it is but it's tiny. The water went up to about waste high to me in the deep end and I'm about 5'9\". It also is right next door to a massive garage that's got some pretty loud fans coming from it that you can help but notice their humming sound in the background. There also surprisingly isn't much of a pool service. They do come around every once in a while but if you want a drink you just need to take a short walk over to the bar to order your drink. Some positives are the in-pool chairs that are always awesome to relax in. There are about 9 day beds and some chairs on the side of the pool, with two \"cabanas' at the end. Everything is first come first serve so if you want your pool time you've got to snag your spot. You can't reserve anything (believe me I tried). There is a massive building that towers over the pool so for a few hours during afternoon the pool is in complete shade followed by about another hour of sun, then it disappears behind the next building. So, again it's really hard to review because it's just the location in this case, not much to do with the grounds or staff or anything else.I did have a couple issues with house keeping. When we checked in to our suite, there was a dirty diaper just sitting on the floor. Kind of gross. We called down and they had someone come up. What surprised me was that we did not get the vibe that they were sorry there was a nasty dirty diaper left in our suite. Just came up, grabbed it, and left. Our second night we planned an amazing dinner at a local stake house. I highly recommend stopping at Mortons to anyone whose hungry for amazing steak. Anyway, when we got back from the pool to get ready for dinner the room wasn't cleaned ( we were gone from about (12:00pm-5pm and yes we did take the do not disturb sign off when we left). So, I called down and they said they would send somebody up. We left and went for a walk and came back about 45 minutes later as we were really pressed for time at this point. The house keeper literally just came in made the bed, and replaced towels. Didn't clean a single thing or take out any of the trash or room service items from the morning. Again, we were in the \"Delux corner suite\". I actually went downstairs to make their manage aware of this, she did apologize and offered to make it right by sending someone up but by that point I just was over it and wanted to spend time in the room.Over all this location has some great highs but it certainly has it's limitations. The staff are all great, the food is awesome and reasonable price, drinks are fantastic, pool is cool and hip but just in bad location, and the rooms are beautiful. Only thing that keeps it from being \"Very good\" is just the limitations of the property because of it's location and quaintness."

The shower was hot and had good pressure and flow. The bed was comfortable and together with blackout curtains helped for a fantastic sleep. It's very quiet. Located centrally and right opposite the huge Hilton Hawaiian Village complex. Lots of restaurants and take away close by and only a short walk to the beach and Galleria for the Waikiki Trolley sightseeing buses, although many actually stop just up the road at the Ilukai Hotel. WiFi was excellent. Enough power points. Would stay again."

        "review_text": "From check in, you are charged a $23 per day for a \"convenience fee\" which covers WiFi and breakfast and all other normal hotel things that are always included...SO when you see free WiFi, the actual cost is $23 per day. Breakfast is the most disappointing thing i have ever seen, which is included in the $23 per day, you get an assortment of juices, 2 Quaker granola bars, 2 non ripe fruits, (apple or orange), and some questionable pastry in a lunch box which you get to keep. You can not get more food, this is it for the day. So for $23 that's it. Location of hotel is not great either, a few blocks up towards the Maona Surfrider is much nicer. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Rooms were out dated to say the least, bathroom looks like it was from the 80's, and the ceiling in bathroom was leaking on first day. The king bed we reserved was not available and apparently is only a request, so we got 2 double beds. In addition the balcony was not even big enough for 2 people to stand on.. It also didn't help that the employees were on strike in front of the hotel at 6am. Overall The hotel room is worth about $100 per night, well maybe 75 since there is a mandatory $23 fee you have to pay."

But the concierge service told us that if we take a tour of the newly renovated Hilton Waikiki we will get $150 activity credit. We turned up to find it wasn't a tour at all: it was a full-on timeshare sales presentation.  I think this is poor form from Hilton.  We had great service from all staff at Embassy Suites but being flat out lied to is not OK.  It spoiled our stay."

This hotel's proximity to public transportation made this easy and very enjoyable. The F-Line streetcar stop was a block and a half away. The Powell-Hyde trolley was three and a half blocks away and the Powell-Mason trolley a block and a half away. This left us strategically positioned to enjoy most of San Francisco's excellent and historic public transit. (Use a MUNI pass). Probably the best way to see this city without much automobile parking.There is a concierge desk in the lobby, where one can get information and book tours. We booked the Red & White Line Bridge 2 Bridge tour here and it was excellent. (Also only four blocks to boarding point),Breakfast was adequate; We can't think of a better location."

The room was clean and the bed itself was comfortable, but the bedding was incredibly stiff and uncomfortable. The bathroom shower head needed to be replaced as water spewed in different directions (see video). There was a water issue the last two days of our trip. It was scolding got one morning and the next day, although it was said to be resolved, was not as it was cold. Really inconvenient for someone who enjoys showering every day. The cleaning staff came in one day despite our request not too. They left a cleaning rag in my husband's shaving kit. The Mexican restaurant was okay. T-Bones is a high end restaurant and it was very good. We don't plan on staying there again, but if you chose to, I hope you have a better experience."

Just a small fridge and a coffee percolator. In my opinion a small kettle and a couple of mugs would have been better, so you could choose to make tea! This was a real issue for me. Also during our stay they ran out of English Breakfast tea!!! How is that possible? Not good enough really. The valet parking is a pain, don't see why you can't park yourself, and a pricey $30 a day parking along with $12 resort fee, but the wifi is good. No pool but beach out front is nice and safe with lifeguard. Bed was ok, too small really... we like a king size. This hotel has no frills but is adequate for the price. 15min walk to the start of the Waikiki strip which suited us. Would I come again? Yes, if we had suite and a kettle!!"

        "review_text": "I wanted to give this review a 5 because of the comfortable room and the extremely helpful bellman but too many little things prevented it.  This was a different kind of trip.  My daughter checked in with me to wait for her flight an hour later.  My husband was flying in late that night from a another location so we could connect for a flight home.  I asked the desk clerk if he would give a key to my husband when he arrived as I would be asleep.  He looked at my daughter, then me, sneered and said \"you want a king bed\".  We already told him she wasn't staying, only helping me to the room because I am in a wheelchair.  When in the room I wanted a bottle of water but the snack center was locked so my daughter took me back to the lobby to purchase one in the gift shop but it was temporarily closed.  The line at guest services was long so when my daughter left for her flight I rolled back to my room and called guest services and asked how to get into the snack center.  The gentleman said I should have been offered a key at check in, also should have been given a bottle of water.  I was offered neither.  The room could have used some maintenance; the smoke detector was hanging from the wall (isn't that a safety violation?) and the paint was peeling from the bathroom ceiling with paint chips falling on the floor and tub. The room could have used a good dusting.  I didn't want to roll myself back down to a restaurant so I ordered room service.  A club sandwich and a small coffee was almost $50.00  I know room service is expensive but this was ridiculous. Comfortable room, unprofessional desk clerk and a room in need of maintenance.  Because of the snack bar problem the check out desk clerk comped the water from the snack center.  Would we return?  Not sure."

They were all dirty and hadn't been cleaned properly. In three rooms sheets didn't fit. Too many things wrong to mention. We found staff ok. One lift wasn't working and other two just could not cope with traffic especially when housekeeping were using them. Nothing much in the area, either a drive or long walk or the free Miami shuttle which was excellent. Do your homework because the very nice hotels down in south beach aren't much more money especially when you have to pay $25 a day parking and $10  day for Internet. Pool ok and beach nice but that's it folks. It needs a major refurb and updating but somehow it is extremely busy with a very small reception so it can take an easy hour to check in or out. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."

        "review_text": "My family always books two 2 bedroom suites for our family reunion in Hawaii. We've stayed here 5 times since 2012--most recently in July through August 2017. Every single time we've stayed, the service has been excellent. The front desk, valet, maids, bellman and other staff that we run in to are all friendly and helpful. The rooms are perfect--awesome views with a huge balcony; washer and dryer in your room; AWESOME location--right in the middle of Waikiki. When you check in, you are greeted with smiles and a cold refreshing towel to freshen up. We use the kitchen and dishwasher every day because my son has food allergies and all of his meals need to be home cooked. The maids replenish the shampoo, conditioner, lotion, paper towels, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc. every day. Just across the street is a beautiful beach where you can rent beach chairs and umbrellas. The beach across the street is perfect for little ones. My husband and I surfed at the beach across the street and we took my family on an outrigger canoe ride--which is all available across the street. If you need anything, there is an ABC right downstairs. For those who love to shop, every store you think of is just downstairs and within walking distance. The location is excellent, the staff is excellent, and the hotel is perfect--especially for those with little ones. We will be back again."

Our room was at the back of the hotel, so no noise from the street. A little noise from extractors or air conditioning outside, but nothing that disturbed us.Wifi was simple to connect to, reliable and reasonably quick.Bus stop for the centre of San Francisco (and the Embarcadero area and Fisherman's Wharf) is just round the corner from the hotel (opposite corner of same block). Service is about every 12 minutes during the day. Ask reception for more details - they were very helpful.There are no facilities for meals in the hotel, but nearby there are many restaurants serving breakfast, during the day and evening meals. Again reception have some very helpful suggestions, and a list they can give you.If in San Francisco again, I wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel."

        "review_text": "First the positive, the location is good for easy access to the Pike Market area and the Alaska cruise docks. However if you're not going or arriving on a cruise I can't really recommend this hotel. At times the lobby reminded me of the Seattle Airport, bags and people everywhere and not easy to walk in and out of the hotel. There is an Alaska cruise boat in the Seattle cruise port almost every day, so the hotel is always busy. The biggest disappointment was the noise level in our room. We could here everything that was going in the rooms on either side of us and I'm just talking about normal conversations we could hear when we had the TV off. Turns out that there is a busy major railroad track right behind the hotel and every time a train went by you can hear it and feel it in the room. The service at the front desk was indifferent and frustrating. I'm a Marriott Elite member and I stay at a lot of great Marriott hotels every year and unfortunately this is not one of them and one hotel I wouldn't be staying at again."

        "review_text": "Not happy about my experience this time. It started with the key cards not working. We carried our bags up to the room and tried both cards and they didn't work. My daughter went downstairs and the lady that originally assisted me when I checked in assisted my daughter as well. She asked my daughter if I had a phone in my hand while trying to open the door. My daughter told her that I didn't. She reset the same cards and my daughter came back up and they still didn't work. My daughter went back downstairs and a man by the name of Henry came back up with her. He saw that the key cars didn't work and he even used his own and the door still wouldn't open. He was finally able to open the door with an actual key for the door as opposed to the key card and there was a very foul odor. We went back downstairs and I asked to speak with a manager. The manager Christian Valadez upgraded us to a princess suite with a \"strip\" view. The point of me asking for the manager wasn't to get a free \"upgrade.\" It was more so to understand where we as guests felt about it all. My daughter informed me that the lady that assisted us wasn't apologetic at all. I just accepted the room because I just wanted to get in a room.My daughter also said the lady at the front desk referred to Henry as \"the big black man\" and said will be out soon when she informed her he was going to go to the room to try the key cards out with her and try to figure it out. My daughter is half African American and she found it offensive that she would refer to him in that way. I also gave my feedback about this to Christian and he said he would talk to her about it. I don't feel that he was sincere and just said what he felt was the  right thing to say.Aside from that, my daughter wanted to use the in room jacuzzi. I was already asleep by the time she decided to. She said she pressed the button to activate it and 5 minutes later, water squirted all over the place and reached all the way to the mirror and all over the flop. She tried it ago 5 minutes later and this time she said dirty flakes came out and she was completely disgusted by it. Obviously she turned it off and drained the water and didn't utilize it.What I have mentioned so far is sufficient enough to call it a horrible experience.In addition to that the internet connection is slow, the room needs to be updated and most importantly cleaned thoroughly. I have taken the courtesy of taking pictures of the condition of various parts of the room along with the uncleanliness of it. My daughter also took pictures so that I can see them and I have attached them as well. I am not sure if the name of the lady that we had this bad experience with but I am sure if Christian is asked, he will probably know who I am referring to.   It's a shame because I enjoyed the few times I have stayed at this hotel in the past. All of the valet guys are great, it's conveniently located close to the strip and spacious rooms. However I don't think I will be back."

The staff are very friendly and on check in, we were upgraded to a bigger room on a higher floor without us asking. We booked on their website and got a free limo transfer to the airport.

The front desk staff could be a little more personable and welcoming.  The valets and shuttle drivers were all very nice and willingly answered questions.  Only ate in the restaurant one time for breakfast which was delicious and well presented.  Was very surprised upon checkout to be asked for additional monies in the form of a \"resort fee\".  This was not mentioned in our reservations or when we checked in.  If you advertise free shuttle service and wifi, but then try to charge for it at the end, it's no longer a free service.  I could see a \"resort fee\" if you had a pool, fitness center or a spa.  Glad we did not rent a car; I heard parking was a whopping fee per night."

        "review_text": "This is the historic hotel for Honolulu. It's main building exudes class and charm. The massive, almost floor to ceiling map of the Hawaiian island chain made for the hotel in the early part of the 20th century that hangs in the lobby is testimonial to the Hotel's status as the grande dame of properties in Honolulu.The location can't be beat. Right on Waikiki beach, but simultaneously secluded from the hustle and bustle of restaurants and malls only a few feet away. It also shares pools / amenities with the Sheraton Waikiki right next door. This is a great arrangement that both properties benefit from. You can charge food and other items to your RH room when shopping / eating at the Sheraton and can use their great pool which has lots of slides for the kids.The cleaning staff, bell men and porters are uniformly wonderful. Excellent attitude and always say aloha and they mean it. Inexplicably, the front desk and concierge staff seem not to care about the guests and don't make you feel welcome of try to help you out. I see I'm not the only reviewer here to notice this.Also, I too was there during Hurricane Lane and found the management response inadequate. Granted it's an unusual situation, but the hotel essentially shut down without any formal communication to the guests - like a letter under the door or something. I asked the front desk about evacuation plans or what to do in case the lobby flooded, but they had no information for me. I asked for a flash light or other battery powered light in case we lost power, but received nothing. Fortunately this proved unnecessary, but I was not impressed by the communication or response here.Bottom line, we'd stay here again for the location and history, but I'm very tempted to book the Sheraton next time to see if we get better service and still be able to wander over to the RH for a drink or something."

I enjoyed several meals in the bar where I was made to feel comfortable and relaxed. The library with a roaring fire was a cozy nook for a cup of tea in the afternoon  or a place to enjoy complimentary coffee in the mornings. The concierge was helpful and the location was perfect for visiting the White House and the Smithsonian museums etc. After a busy day it was a lovely retreat to come home to.

There is also a deck & sitting area up on the roof if you just want to relax.There are snack machines, drink machines & ice machines available on various floors and a few nice deli's within walking distance.Breakfast is provided in the front foyer area each morning and is a welcome surprise to most of the places we have stayed where you get nothing or you pay extra.There is a stop for the Hop on/Hop of bus directly out the front of the hotel and it is a great way to see this beautiful city as it covers a large area.The waterside area of Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 & the Embarcado are about a 20 minute walk away, but it is pleasant and easy walk.The famous 'squiggly bit' of Lombard Street is a few blocks away up the hill, but is definitely worth a walk if you are able.The staff were very friendly and always helpful, which makes any stay a better one."

        "review_text": "I stayed near one of the other reviewers for the same medical conference last week, in 8121. The room is adjacent to a service elevator which unfortunately sounds like workmen drilling every time it runs. There's also a set of service stairs adjacent to the room, in which staff sometimes gather to talk, all of which can be heard in the room. Luckily, there were no bugs in the room and the window opens, which allows the room to be aired out nicely.There was ALWAYS a long line for the front desk, no matter what time, and the staff were overworked, irritable, and less than helpful. On going to the restaurant on the first floor, I found that my spoon had been used by someone to stir coffee (there was still some coffee in the spoon).There appears to be some work taking place to redo the lobby. There is no club level and rooms need to be refreshed. $900+ for room plus parking for three nights; there are MANY alternatives to be considered."

        "review_text": "Just left this hotel to travel to Maui after 6 wonderful days here.Views looking out to the sea are amazing, staff are helpful and food in Dukes is delicious. The location is spot on with a great chilled beach vibe. There is a vast array of shops and restaurants within walking distance. The V47 club is not really worth the money in terms of what alcohol is included. One evening several tables were reserved which seems odd to me. Yes the pool is on the small side but the beach is at your door step so it is not an issue.Now for a word of caution, we booked 3 trips through Expedia who are based in the hotel. The trips, their duration and pick up times were not made clear at the time of booking. In fact we had a surprise or two whilst on a tour. A member of staff was keen to book up our trips for Maui too. They took the money and then when we tried to contact them to confirm our pick up details in our Maui resort nobody from Expedia wanted to know. They have a working mobile number and email address. We have spoken to several staff members in the Outrigger Beach Resort and left messages but have been left in limbo. The tour operator, Hoku Hawaii seem very fair and reasonable so I would urge you to book directly with them. Poor customer service from Expedia."

        "review_text": "We stayed here for one night before our morning flight home rather than making the long trek to the airport from Jebel Ali. For this reason we didn't use any of the facilities in the hotel but all looked very good. Fast and efficient check in and our luggage was taken swiftly to our room. We were upgraded from a deluxe room to a superior room which was huge, much bigger than our main holiday hotel room! Room was clean and modern and all facilities worked, and we had a huge bathroom with separate walk in shower which was great for two people getting ready at once in the morning.The only thing I can fault Is the extortionate charge for Internet use in this hotel, I simply refused to connect given the price. It seems strange that Millenium Hotels don't seem to have a company wide internet policy as I have stayed in Millenium Hotels in China for example where the wifi is complimentary. In this day and age complimentary Internet is almost expected and more often than not provided, even in budget hotels, so this came as a bit of a disappointment, otherwise a fantastic short stay would definitely stay again and hopefully get to use some of the facilities the next time!"

        "review_text": "The Congress Plaza opened its doors way back in 1893 - and renovation of the property is well overdue.There were two main issues during my stay - neither of which were rectified. We call them \"lifts\" and the Americans say \"elevators\", but either way they were awful. Two were completely out of service for the duration of my 1-week stay which resulted in huge queues and waits of up to 15 minutes! The worst part was that at no time did I see any sign of workmen attempting to fix the problem.The second issue was a bizarre maid service system where a lady used to knock on my door at around 9am to ask whether I needed my room cleaned. The first time this happened I thought it was quite impressive - until I had to wait until 5pm for the maid to actually show up.On one occasion I had to call housekeeping because they didn't send anyone and I would estimate the average time the maid arrived was well past 3pm.The hotel might have a glamorous history (the walls are lined with photos of famous people who've stayed there including several Presidents) but I doubt this is on Mr Obama's radar. The whole place has a musty, almost grimy feel to it, and the majority of the staff, whilst well-meaning, almost have a resigned air suggesting they know that the product they offer is inferior.Frankly, you can do so much better for the same price - avoid!"

We had breakfast at nearby McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks. It\u2019s ideal for museum visits. We did some in the morning, came back for some rest and went out again. There are a lot of street food trucks for employees from government buildings so the quality was very good. The hotel also has washers and dryers for guests. CVS is basically next door. Parking is $40 per day at the hotel so we parked our car at the Union Station which is $24 per day. Groupon had a deal for $53 for three days. No in and out privileges though. We didn\u2019t need the car anyway. The DC Circulator is free for all. The stops are close to the hotel. Only two stops to the Union Station and it circulates around the nation mall.We had a dinner at the hotel and the food was very nice. Definitely a great hotel in Washington DC."

        "review_text": "I booked this hotel online, paid about $500 for the weekend. As I think a normal person would, I thought the advertised price and the price charged at check out was the full price, I was wrong.I made the mistake of giving them my credit card for a \"security deposit,\" I received the security deposit back in full but I was charged almost $100 worth in \"facility fees.\" These fees are not optional, they come with no perks, they just double charge you for the same room. In short, what was advertised as a $500 weekend was actually $600. You are given no warning about this extra $100 you will pay, they will charge your credit card without your permission, and it is in no way a part of the advertised price.Apparently this hotel is just one hotel in DC that takes part in this scam, kill resort fees.com provides a list of hotels in DC that will charge you these \"facility fees.\"As far as the room itself, it was average, the restaurant there too is also average, you can get way better food in DC. Ultimately, if you are willing to spend $600 for a weekend, you can probably find a better hotel."

        "review_text": "This hotel is lovely although it was not the experience we hoped for and has a few things to look at to provide a real 5 star experience. We arrived from 5 nights at the Four seasons in Maui with outstanding service and care which only served to highlight their lacking. There wasn't a lei on arrival, no alohas anywhere and no mahalos unless we intitiated them, all things that which makes Hawaiian hotels special. We could have been at any good hotel. They did place small presents  on the bed with beautiful quotes on message cards which were lovely. We had a junior ocean suite which accommodated my husband and I with our 9yo son in a rollaway. The room was lovely although ocean views were through the low buildings of the hotel. It advertised 2 lanai's/balconies although one was only a step out to see Diamond Head. We did have a few electrical issues in the room with lights turning off randomly and the sound system glitching. As we weren't there to watch TV, it didn't affect our stay. The pool is lovely and of a reasonable size for Honolulu but the boys were not allowed to play catch with their small ball which definitely affected our experience there. All restaurants overlook the ocean. Their top restaurant La Mer was outstanding but of course very expensive as Hawaii's only 5 diamond restaurant. Orchids was lovely and had a nice ambience to it, with ala a carte breakfast, lunch and dinner and dress code. Room without a Key is their casual near the pool restaurant and was disappointing both in service, food quality and range of food, although the breakfast buffet was ok. My husbands caesar salad was eclipsed by the one he'd had the day before at the very low priced Denny's over the road. To their credit when they were informed of the poor quality of the chicken, the food services manager apologised profusely and did not charge us for the meal. The poolside menu was very limited. Luckily the other restaurants and room service improved our opinions. Overall this a lovely hotel although not the greatest if you have children and definitely not reflective of the kind of service we've experienced at other 5 star hotels"

He took care of all my concerns and told me if there was anything else that we needed, to see him and it would be taken care promptly. A true gentleman who always greeted us with a smile.

        "review_text": "Recently stayed at the Congress Plaza Hotel. This property is an old-world gem replete with an electric red marquee on the top of the hotel. It is located on South Michigan Avenue across from Grant Park and many attractions (Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, etc.).Inside on the lobby level you will find decor that features plenty of wood, marble, high-quality fixtures, and comfortable furniture. Even the display cases feature beautiful photos of the ballrooms shown off to great splendor.Once you get to the guest elevators and guest rooms, however, the hotel loses a lot of luster. My room (which was upgraded to a lakefront view) did have a bay window, but the space was tight, the paint was peeling, and the bathroom was the size of a postage stamp. One bright spot was the bed, which is the most comfortable bed I have encountered during travel! The room temperature could not really be controlled - only heat and no thermostat. The workout room was in one of the towers (the opposite tower of mine) so you had to go down, up, and around on the elevators. It was just a small hotel room with some workout equipment dumped in - strange. Also the cable (which was listed as premium cable) was pretty limited in the guest rooms and in the workout room.In any case, I liked the location and the price. Overall it would be better to take clients here for drinks or host an event in a ballroom than it would be to have clients stay here."

And what I found was this: very small, very clean room, nice view of Riverside Park, West Side Highway, and the river. Microwave & fridge. Comfy bed. And super-nice, super-friendly staff! I had to change my original online reservation; I called and spoke with Felicia, who was able to accommodate my new travel plans. There is always someone at the front desk and that someone is always friendly.This place is small, 17 really narrow floors served by two tiny elevators. But the location is great - short walk to Broadway, Amsterdam Ave., more restaurants than even I could eat at. It took me about half an hour to walk across the park to the Met. There's a subway station at Broadway & 79, and several nearby bus stops.If you like spending time in your hotel room, or if you plan on having friends stop by, this is not the place for you. But if you need a place to sleep, shower & stash your stuff, it's perfect. It's very clean, and with the AC going, I never heard another guest. My only complaint is that taking a shower at 7 or 8 in the morning is an unpleasant adventure  with strange fluctuations in water pressure and random hot & cold.Definitely recommend for travelers who go to New York to see the city and not their hotel."

        "review_text": "This hotel is in a great location, has a big feel, but is not well maintained nor does it provide many of the amenities that less expensive hotels provide. The room was clean and we paid extra to get a good view with large windows. However, the windows were missing the inner shade that allows daylight but blocks full view for people looking in. So for us, it was either using the black out curtains or keeping it open. The rooms don't have a refrigerator, instead they have a mini-fridge that charges you for everything. The furniture in the room was a little warn out as well.They don't offer continental breakfast, I have stayed at 5 star places that still offer the continental breakfast and this hotel doesn't. If you want breakfast you have to get it at a restaurant but don't go to the one attached to the hotel. The restaurant attached is not very good and understaffed. The first sign that it wasn't very good should have been that there were only a few tables filled during a dinner hour.The biggest upset was going down to the pool area with expectations to relax in the spa and finding that they don't have one! They don't have a hot tub!Lastly, the hotel is poorly maintained. The lobby area is nice but the elevators are missing the text on many of the buttons, the carpet is old throughout, and we opted out of taking the stairwell because of graffiti and drug paraphernalia. We paid for an expensive view room but the bathroom was something out of a motel 6. I have paid $100 less a night and still got the Jacuzzi tub before.Summary: This hotel is not worth the price. Go to a newer one."

We are rarely in our room when we go to Vegas so we didn't care about that.  The staff is very friendly.  They definitely cater to the Hawaiin's and there food reflects that.  We at in the Redwood Bar and Grill.  We were not that impressed. The food was good but the price was outrageous.  We were comped part of the bill so that helped.We at in the Market Street Cafe for breakfast and had the buffet.  It was okay.  We spent the majority of our time across the street at the Main Street.  Because they are all owned by Boyd the points you accumulate are altogether on your players card.  We had to ask for comps at the Cal but at the Main Street they offered the pit boss offered them to us.We didn't think the smoke was bad compared to the casinos right on Fremont or at the Orleans where we have stayed in the past.My husband was on crutches and the bellmen were extremely kind beckoning cabs right into the parking garage rather than having to go out on the street.where one would normally get a cab."

But the thing that makes this hotel special is its friendly staff and outstanding service.  From the moment we arrived, everyone was at the ready to make sure we enjoyed every minute of our time in San Fran.  They didn't work any miraculous feats -- such as securing the perpetually sold-out Alcatraz tickets -- but it didn't matter.  Their kindness and eager helpfulness made us feel right at home.  Note -- strangely, WiFi -- a basic included utility at most hotels -- was an expensive supplemental charge at Scarlet Huntington."

We walked everywhere from here.  Rooms were ok size, tight for 2 double beds however workable.  everything was very clean, staff were extremely helpful, rooms service quality was good.  Gym faciilites were very good - the welcome drinks each night were great, they looked after the kids with juice, soft drink and chips/ drawing etc and was a nice way to meet other people, it had a really nice feel.  it is the best value place i have stayed in San Francisco and would stay here again."

Stayed at this hotel back from 2012 to 2017 thought I would give it another chance I regret I did. My only complaint with this hotel is they don't value Hilton Honors very much and they also show no appreciation to a lifetime Diamond member that has stayed over a Thousand Nights with Hilton the front desk did not even know what a lifetime Diamond was I gave them my lifetime Diamond Card she handed it back to me and told me this is not a credit card at the same time she had my American Express card in her hand I asked her for a room with one king bed instead of two queens she was kind enough to Grant my request only to place me on the bottom floor with a view of a metal fence in front of my window facing the back of the pool I've stayed at many rooms in this hotel she could have given me a nicer room I asked she goes we don't do that here. This hotel is a great hotel if you can get it off TripAdvisor Expedia hotels.com if you are a diamond member with Hilton or lifetime diamond there is zero benefits at this property they charge you $25 a day for two bottles of water cheap water at that they used to give Avion back in 2017 now they've went to the plain wrap brand being a lifetime diamond we already get high speed internet we already get water but this property charges you $25 a day for two bottles of water they do not give you room upgrades they do not give free breakfast all you get are your Hilton points you're much better off staying at a beautiful Embassy Suites DoubleTree Hampton Inn Homewood Suites this property is good if you can find a cheap on Expedia and you're not a Hilton Honors member the housekeeping is amazing the snack bar and the employees that work there make very delicious food and take care of the customers exceptionally well the security team is also very friendly always on the property and always looking out for the guests and keeping the property safe the hotel is spotless beautiful inside and out it's just too bad they do not appreciate Hilton honor Diamond members are lifetime Diamond members nor is there any benefits for us being Hilton honor members sad to say I will not be visiting this property again too many other nice  properties out there that take care of us members and appreciate our business. I didn't get to see the one lady who's a supervisor at the front desk her name is Leanne she is amazing ."

It has a nice pool area a good wifi service all over the hotel a hospitality room & you couldnt find more helpful staff anywhere its like the true hawaiian spirit that seems to have died in all of the big corporate hotel chains. Mahalo to everyone at the hotel the owner should be proud of you ! & if we can afford to come back next year we will be seeing you soon.Mahalo again & well done."

The lady was super nice, but said she couldn't guarantee anything.Upon arrival, we came in at 5am from Seattle and we're tired. We called the hotel to see if we could nap in the lobby until our room was ready and they informed us that our reservation had notes for early check in and to come on over as our room was ready!The check in process was quick and easy and the lobby was beautiful! When we got to our room and opened the door, we were in heaven. The room was one of the renovated rooms and on the 10th floor in the corner so we not only had a balcony with a Georgia's view, but we had a nectar window over our tv. The room was clean and spacious and the bed was HUGE!Later that evening we noticed the light on the balcony was burnt our and within minutes they had someone up to fix it.The location of the hotel is perfect! The pool area clean and tiki bar clean too. Loved walking just steps to the boardwalk and beach. During the day they have a live sexiphone player in the lobby which adds to the ambiance. The whole hotel smells good, I don't know what they use to freshen it up, but every time you walk in the lobby it's refreshing.I read reviews about this hotel and was worried about what we were getting ourselves into, but I can tell you that we didn't experience any of the things people complained about. This hotel stay was one of the best with the combination of the staff, the cleanliness, location, everything! In house reservations is on top of it! We will for sure be coming back next time with the kids. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay great!"

Waikiki beach is a straight walk out of the front entrance.The hotel is served well by tourist buses and public transport.For those who are used to European Hilton's, you will find that there is no buffet breakfast. It's a menu and waitress service.

        "review_text": "This hotel is one of 3 newer hotels within 2 blocks of each other.  The other 2 are a Courtyard which is adjacent to the Metro stop and a Hilton Garden Inn which is adjacent to the Metro rail.  This Hyatt is a short easy 2 block walk from the Metro.The staff were excellent, probably the most helpful and friendly I've encountered outside of the Ritz-Carlton chain.  The room was a \"Wow\" when I walked in.  My room faced NY Avenue and had a nice city-scape view of evening lights.  Not as much of a wow during the day but still nice.  The room was excellent, clean, neat.  They provide a mini-fridge and a coffee maker - no microwave.  Free and excellent wifiThe free breakfast offered several hot items, pancakes or French toast, several styles of hot breakfast sandwiches, several cold cereals, fruit, yogurts, breads, etc.  One of the nicest free breakfasts I've encountered.  There is a bar that serves a limited menu for lunch and dinner.The down side is that NY Avenue is very busy and there is construction underway across the street of the back side of the hotel.  So if you are a light sleeper, this may not be the best place for you even though noise insulation is very good.  I had no issues but I heard a few guests complain at the front desk.  I don't think the Courtyard would be any better.  The Garden Innis on a quieter street but is close to the Metro line noise.There are only 1 or 2 sit-down restaurants nearby.  There are several fast food and sandwich shops.  A full size grocery store and pharmacy are about 5 minute walk away (adjacent to the Garden Inn).  Like most of DC there are vagrants in the area, particularly at night.  I would not recommend women walking alone in the dark.Personally, I really enjoyed my stay and would stay again."

That did not deter the staff from being helpful and patient.  The room was great, but the view of the ocean was less than ideal.  The room was on the side of another hotel and the noise traveled quickly and loudly.  Street noise was a nuisance too.  However, being on the beach, the large, beautiful room, the staff, and the \"history museum\" on the premises more than made up for any of the negatives.  What an amazing older hotel with so much rich history.  Bar none, I would stay there again in a heartbeat . . . if only for the attention of the incredible staff.  Oh . . . and have breakfast there every morning.  They have a killer buffet!"

We asked if we could be upgraded to an ocean view and there were none available.  They did upgrade us to the Club Level since we are Marriott Gold Rewards, which was very nice. A hot breakfast was available each morning. They told us to check back later for an ocean view room and we did. Tom Moscato was able to work his magic and put us in a beautiful ocean view room.  We had lunch at the restaurant on the property overlooking the ocean and it was perfect.  I cannot say enough great things not only about the property, but also about the staff. Everyone went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful  The rooms are very well appointed. I know some claim that they are small, but honestly, they are beautifully done and plenty of room for 2 people.  The bathrooms were very nice, great shower and overall, lovely. The location of this property could not have been better.  Yes, you are off the beaten path, by about 2 blocks, but that is what makes it perfect.  You are on the beach, away from the noise and only have to go 2 blocks before you are in the middle of all of the action. We rented chairs and an umbrella each day; I think it was $39 a day, well worth it.  If you are staying at a hotel on the beach, why would you want to sit near the pool?  The property is under construction, but that didn\u2019t impact our stay at all.  My husband and I are looking forward to going back next year when the renovations are complete\u2026I am sure it will be amazing. Overall, one of the best Marriott\u2019s we have ever stayed at!!"

It\u2019s door and walls are made of frosted glass that doesn\u2019t reach the ceiling, and leaves a visible gap. Even with the door closed, someone standing at the sink, which is directly adjacent, would have a clear view of the person using the toilet. And this setup isn\u2019t out of sight, like bathrooms normally are, but is in plain view of about a third of the room. Our room had two beds, which makes this room design all the more baffling; it is clearly intended for people who aren't familiar enough to share a bed, yet who are fine with seeing and hearing each other use the bathroom.

When we arrived we were checked in within 20 mins but on entering our room we realised we had a basic too when we had paid for a corner suite. My husband went to reception and was told that \" just because we request this doesn't mean we would get a corner suite\"! Not happy at all we spoke with the on duty Manager who advised us that there wasn't a room available until next day! Not a great start but we did eventually get moved the next afternoon. Rooms are basic, a little bit tired but the location of the hotel itself was excellent. Can be very noisy as overlooks Freemont Street but we didn't mind this at all. The D Grill was fab, no room service but if you call they will have your order ready for collection. Not sure if I would stay here again as like I say it is dated and the pool is across the street with no pool bar and very small but all in all if your looking for no thrills then this is your place! One downside which put me ff daily was a sort of protesters with a banner saying it should be closed due to health standards! Not something guests like to see."

A really good value for your money, and this is the only hotel that don't collect a resort fee.I will definitely come back here again:))4 star rating."

The clients that are now attracted to this casino are low class and do not know how to behave in public. Security is nowhere to be found when there is problems. The restaurant use to be one of the best in vegas but now is junk the steaks are a step up from a bad buffet servers never ask how the food is. I was told the F&B Director changed about 2 years ago, might be worth the money to bring that person back. I even won over $150.00 and still have bad views of this place tear it down and start over folks."

We had an early check in , 11am, which was most appreciated after a night flight from Australia which arrived in Honolulu at 6am. We were given an upgrade and the room and view were excellent.The hotel staff were fantastic, as first time visitors to Hawaii they answered all our many questions and proved to be a great source of information and guidance.The lobby and pool areas were smaller than we expected but more than adequate. Breakfast hours of 6.30am to 8.30am were our only problem but the fare was fine. The complimentary tea, coffee and other drinks that were available all day plus the afternoon popcorn was a nice touch."

        "review_text": "Stayed 6 nights in a 3 person room in the 12th floor. I found the hotel a bit overpriced at first but considering the other hotel prices around the area it turned out to be average priced. The hotel is in a historical building so it is a bit dated yet nothing to be concerned with. The windows sealed the noise so no issues with the traffic. The location is amazing- couldn't have it any better! The rooms aren't big but the beds are very comfy. The toilet was running so that was a bit annoying.Several other reviews mention the water pressure and I agree with it- the pressure isn't that great and the shower heads are small, I felt like part of my body was always outside the water range.We were in the room very limited amount of time since we were touring around so overall I would recommend the hotel and would certainly come back!!"

We had booked the room (two double beds) several months ahead, so we paid a very reasonable price.The room was toward the back--away from Lombard Street--and was quiet.  It was clean and spacious.The hotel staff (especially David) was very helpful.The location of the hotel is convenient.  There are a number of small restaurants within a short walking distance.The public transportation system in San Francisco is wonderful, and nearby the hotel are bus stops.  The hotel staff will give you accurate directions.We took a shuttle which the hotel staff recommended to the airport.All in all, it was a great hotel, quite economical (if reserved ahead of time), very clean, and conveniently located.We will stay here again should we return to San Francisco."

        "review_text": "My husband and I came for a one night stay cation while attending a concert at the Waikiki Shell. Upon approaching the reception desk, I immediately felt a negative atmosphere. I asked if our room was ready. The receptionist declined to check me in because it was too early (that's fine), but also because my name wasn't on the reservation,  but my husband's instead. She was rude and said that because he was not present I could not check in. It's my husband!! I told her he was working and when off work would arrive at the hotel to check us in. I also offered her his cell phone so she could call him to confirm he was, in fact, my husband. (We have the same last name). She said she would \"make an exception\" and check us in, but would have to charge me as a hotel guest, which was not on the original reservation. Seriously. Fine.So after that awful experience and pleasantry, I went to the pool to wait until I could to go to the room (aka closet).The pool itself was clean and looked to have been recently renovated. The other patrons of the hotel were disrespectful of the other guests. Several cigarette and marijuana smokers were present, taking zero consideration of other guests. Where were the hotel attendants?This hotel is showing lots of wear and tear. Our room was no bigger than a closet! We reserved a kaima'ana rate room, and it was not doubt, half the size of a normal room.  It was obviously one corner room split into two miserably sized rooms. It was an insult.I would recommend spending money elsewhere. There are plenty of Waikiki hotels, and this is not even decent on a budget."

I would love to come back but once the room cost gets over $500 or so it is just very highly priced. Overall I highly recommend due to the club level.Nice location but not many great views compared to the Fairmont. We had dinner in the restaurant one night and it was better than average. Nice overall stay."

At breakfast, the woman said, the guy before you was talking about the noise, too.When I lived in NYC and was used to a lot of City noise, I think I could have lived with this, but not anymore.I will say that if city noise does not bother you, the pictures are accurate and the location is great.However, I have to fail this place for me because if you cannot get a good rest, it's hard to say it's the good hotel.Staff was very nice."

The hotel is just beautiful and replete with genuine marble, sparkling Italian chandeliers, sumptuous carpeting, and the best service I've ever received at a hotel - anywhere.My hotel room was good sized, the bed was soft enough to sleep on my back [I am a side sleeper and need a really soft mattress, which is not what most people want/need], and the room was so clean!The amenities in the bath were what one needed: shower gel, shampoo & conditioner, bar soap, shower cap, and cotton swabs.  A definite plus was the facial tissue.  I am not kidding!  At every other hotel, the typical tissue is scratchy at best.  Here, it was bona fide Kleenex tissues.  My nose was most appreciative.At our meetings, the staff who set up the rooms were so very nice and amenable to our needs at all times.  The catering staff was simply fantastic - as was the food!Simply put, I don't have enough compliments to adequately convey just how nice everyone was.If you're considering staying at this hotel - do so!  You will not be disappointed!Oh, side note:  there is a steak house restaurant at the ground floor of the hotel with a great bar and friendly staff."

        "review_text": "Just stayed for three nights on the way from Hawaii to the UK. Arrived late in the evening and were treated by the friendly doorman and front desk staff. Was allocated a room on the eighth floor overlooking the rear of the property.Room was of a good size and well appointed. The beds were comfortable and there was some storage for clothes. Bathroom was a good size with a shower, the bath was weird though far too shallow for a proper bath!Noise wise we never heard any other residents during our stay although there was a weird rumbling sound which I'm assuming was the nearby cable car. As others have mentioned I would have expected tea/ coffee making facilities to be available and indeed complementary bottled water. Wifi was included in the rate and had a good speed.Breakfast was not included in our rate and we ate in the restaurant on two mornings. The breakfast was of good quality but service was painfully slow. Each morning there was only one person working the tables. On the last morning the restaurant was closed for a private function! Really, no conference room? It's one if the very few hotels I've stayed in that has no bar or lounge or coffee area so the hotel feels a little sterile.The hotel is situated quite well although don't expect to be able to use the cable cars from here as their far too crowded, read the reviews on the cable cars and you'll see why. You'll have to walk or use a cab to get anywhere. Having said that It's only a ten minute walk into China town or five minutes down into Union Square.Best point of this hotel - The staff."

        "review_text": "Returning from Spring break in Mexico with my wife and kids (girl 6, boy 9) we landed in Chicago to find out our connecting flight back to Nashville was cancelled, as were all flights for that night and the next morning due to a March blizzard this past Monday morning. I have stayed at the Four Season Chicago in the past with my wife and travel to Chicago every month for work, but not with the kids in tow. Since all the hotels around the airport were booked, I checked online through American Express and they had a room at the Four Seasons at a reasonable price so we booked it.Needless to say, my wife and I were a little wary since the kids were with us, however we were quickly overcome with a tremendous welcome from the doorman the moment we stepped out of the Taxi, and he didn't bat an eye at the fact the kids still had on their Flip flops and shorts and it was snowing!Once we got up to the Front Desk, we were greeted by Amanda who was very gracious and immediately alleviated our fears about bringing kids to the Four Seasons. After telling her how we were stranded, she asked our childrens names and took them to a \"Treasure chest\" and let them pick out a small stuffed animal. Then she got us checked in to an upgraded room so we would be more comfortable. She also gave us a flyer with kids activities and info on the Pool and kids club. (FS Manager, Amanda really was the most friendly and helpful Front Desk person I have met in a really long time, and I travel constantly! )Once we got to our room, within minutes there was a knock on the door and a staff member brought hats and t-shirts for our kids and a few other goodies including kids sized robes. They also made out the pull out sofa for my son to sleep on with a down comforter!We then went to eat at Allium (again worried about taking kids) and we were greeted by the hostess and then sat with Brooke who was our server. She was great and the entire restaurant staff made my kids feel welcomed.Then upon returning to the room, there were bed time treats for the kids (cookies and popcorn) thus completing the most welcoming experience I have had at a hotel while traveling with my children. My Wife wrote a note to give to the manager stating how our unexpected stay turned into one of the highlights of our trip on a day that could have ended very disappointing. Both of us were blown away by the Staff's kindness to us as a family. Needless to say, the room (corner suite) was immaculate and the property is what you would expect of a Four Seasons (read my previous review if wanting more details)I have always highly recommended the FS Chicago, now I have reaffirmed why its my top recommendation in Chicago!!!! Thanks!"

Toronto first (incredible, I still remember Thomas, our breakfast waiter), then Montreux (even better, each time I passed the front desk I was greeted by name) and now San Francisco.Check in was good, room upgrade appreciated. So far so good. But downhill from there.We ate at the Tonga restaurant.  $250 for a decidedly average meal. Average is being kind. And it was freezing in there. San Francisco isn't a warm city, so why wind up the air conditioning to max?I wish we hadn't been so dogged in our pursuit of a table there.  My wife asked the concierge three times to book us in.  Three times because we never got a response. In the end I booked myself. We were told it might be difficult to get a table, yet the place was at most only two thirds full.Breakfast is poor for the money and not a patch on Toronto or Montreux.We fancied a drink in the lounge one night, but gave up after only one as it was freezing in there. I don't want to need to wear a sweater indoors in a five star hotel.I did ask at reception about the excessive air con but got a bit of a brush off, and I think that is symptomatic of the biggest issue - I felt no sense of connection with, or care coming from the staff. I was just another paying guest.And to cap it all, the hotel arranged airport transfer from SFO was $230 on arrival yet the same car cost $55 on the way back!  You'll forgive me for feeling ripped off!I wouldn't stay here again. Fairmont should be faultless and this was a let down.  The more I think about it, the more annoyed I get."

        "review_text": "Hello, last month I travelled to the US\u2019 capital. In there, my hotel was this one (Hotel Harrington). I was on a trip with some friends, it was a big group, we booked a room for 4 people. The rooms are all quite old but it\u2019s because it\u2019s an old hotel, for example, there\u2019s no remote control for the air conditioner, you have to pull from an old stained stick. That would the first of my two concerns. The second one is related to food. They have a restaurant downstairs but the food in it it\u2019s not so nice, I mean, one day my breakfast were scrambled eggs and bacon, but the eggs were totally flavorless! Now apart from that, the hotel itself it\u2019s a very good option, at first me and my friends were not too convinced we would have a nice experience in it but in the end, we were happy with it and it\u2019s services, there was good WiFi connection everywhere you were, bathrooms: clean, towels: clean as well, beds pretty comfortable, blankets and furniture, all pretty clean, and for any TV fan, they have pretty good tv\u2019s (in some rooms) !! Oh I almost forgot, the gift shop!!! The gift shop is on the lobby, it has amazing Washington souvenirs at incredibly low prices!!! So I really liked staying in this hotel..."

This hotel appears to be overrun by a party crowd after stepping off the plane shattered all I wanted was a good night sleep. I felt like I was staying in a dorm. the noise from adjacent rooms and the smell of Marjuana in the hallway was overwhelming. This is a hotel for youngsters to go out party and come back and party in there rooms. Booked for 3 nights left after 1. The staff are friendly enough but the clientele is lively to say the least. The aircon is also very noisy. Basically if you like sleep, go elsewhere. Never again."

        "review_text": "The overall running of that hotel seemed a little hectic at times. The line for check-in was very long, though it was reasonable for the elite line (I am platinum). The cleanliness of the room was sub par: when we arrived in the room, half the pillows were stained, and the armchair was covered in sand.The room was otherwise nice, with a great view. Breakfast was simple but all right, I was afraid considering how crowded the hotel was that it would be too hectic but it was fine as the breakfast room is big. It's a shame that the breakfast only runs until 9am, which  is quite early if you want to have a relaxing time in Hawaii. The side effect of this was that it was next to impossible to get onto an elevator to go down just before 9, that could easily take 20 minutes until you got one. The swimming pool was probably big enough for 2 or 3 people to swim at the same time, or maybe up to a dozen to stand, which is ridiculous for a 44-story hotel.Anyway, all of this is barely relevant in regards to the incident we had: a security officer came banging at our door 5 minutes before midnight shouting \"security! Open your door!\". When I asked him to slip his ID through the crack of the door he refused, saying I should be able to see it through the peephole (I barely could see there was an ID on him). When I asked him why I should trust he is who he claims and open the door, his reply was that I would otherwise be charged with trespassing (yes, he really said that!). He also refused to tell me the reason of his visit. After a while when he seemed calmer I agreed to open the door, and only after I let him in did he tell me the reason of his late and threatening visit: the neighbors downstairs saw a little bit of water trickling down from their ceiling. He wanted to come in to check if we had any flooding, saw that there was none, and said a bunch of bad things about the owners and how they don't have a good upkeep of their plumbing.The silver lining is that the next day when I came to complain at the front desk, Gladys received my complaint and acknowledged how unacceptable that is and handled the situation very kindly and professionally. She agreed to discount one night from our trip, though as we booked on points it will have to come in the form of point reimbursement through IHG, for which I am still waiting almost a month later."

        "review_text": "I stayed in an oceanfront room with my husband and two children aged 12 and 9.As stated plenty of times the location is absolutely prime! If you get an oceanfront room your room will have equally as good a view as a Royal Hawaiian tower room at a fraction of the cost ( i know because we stayed in a tower room at Royal Hawaiian last time we came).You cannot compare the Outrigger to either Moana surfrider or The Royal Hawaiian. The Outrigger has no street presence or old world charm. It is dark feeling and not a \u201cpretty\u201d hotel but it does have a Hawaiian feel that is not tacky.The rooms are decent size (at least in oceanfront room). Our room 1026 had two double beds and a comfortable sofa bed. Has a small fridge in the bathroom \u200d\ufe0f coffee maker (drip coffee style) again in the bathroom but not kettle (you can ask for one).As also mentioned before the pool is very small and the pool area pool chairs etc feel very cramped. Also because you need to walk through there to get to beach i cant imagine it would feel relaxing sitting in those pool chairs as it would be super busy.BUT you have a spectacular beach right at your feet. And all the shops are right there for you also!!! You are in the heart of all the action.Special note on the elevator. They are slow and have a funny system and only 3 of them. So more often than not you will be waiting a long time and feel like a herd of cattle being squashed in.My last comment is that if you have loads of money to spend then go to The Royal Hawaiian or Moana Surfrider. If you are on somewhat of a budget but wabt a good hotel in fantastic location then this is a great hotel!"

        "review_text": "This was our first time at Hotel Adagio, located three blocks west of Union Square, and within walking distance from Powell Street BART station. We felt safe during that walk, realizing that this is downtown S.F. which has its share of \"interesting\" street people. The area between the hotel and Union Square is OK - not great.We arrived at 1PM which is two hours before usual check-in time. We were warmly greeted by Christopher at the front desk who truly went out of his way to provide the best customer service to us during our two day stay. He found us a corner room on the 16th floor that was check-in ready. The room was extremely comfortable, very quiet, nicely appointed, and totally absent was any street noise given the direction the room faced.Both mornings we had breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and with our Marriott Gold status the breakfast was complimentary. Restaurant staff were all congenial and helpful. The hotel bar (The Mortimer) is a great place for happy hour, with discounted food and drinks. Bartenders Chris and Matthew did a great job serving from their selection of draft beers and happy hour menu items. Service by all wait-staff, front desk, concierge, porter, and housekeeping at the hotel was excellent.The building is an early 1900's vintage, so the hallways on the room floors are narrow and the two elevators small but efficient. No coffee maker in room - lots of complimentary to-go coffee in the lobby. The lobby and restaurant are also smaller scale than one would find in a recently built hotel, but there is a certain charm to the place and we would absolutely stay at Hotel Adagio again. Whatever the hotel may lack in amenities of a newer building is made up for by the fact each and every staff member we interacted with truly was customer service oriented and seemed to enjoy their work and the hotel guests!!"

        "review_text": "Went for a holiday to Bangkok in October 2016. Would like to share with you guys what is the best mode of transport to take upon arriving at the Don Muang airport. Do no waste time and money going for a taxi especially when the traffic is so bad in Bangkok irregardless of what time of the day!!  At the arrival hall of Don Muang airport, just head to Gate 5 and exit.  Once outside, you can see a waiting area with the sign \"BMTA Bus\".  There are 2 types of buses stopping here ie Bus A1 and A2.  Just hop on to either bus A1 or A2 if you are heading to the city. These buses will bring you to the 1st BTS skytrain station ie Mo Chit and from here you can catch the next BTS skytrain or metro to wherever your destination is!  It only takes about 20 minutes from the airport to the Mo Chit station, The stretch of road from the airport to Mo Chit station is very clear and it's not jam at all. Since Mo Chit station is the 1st station, passengers will definitely get a place to sit therefore no worries even if you are travelling with bulky luggage.  I once tried travelling to Victory Monument by these buses and it took me over an hour compare to only about 7 minutes if you were to travel by the BTS skytrain from Mo Chit station to Victory Monument station!!! It is strongly advise to travel by the BTS skytrain from Mo Chit station onward no matter where your destination is. The stretch of road from Mo Chit station onward is terribly jam and cars are not moving at all!!Buses A1/A2 charge a flat rate of 30 baht irregardless of where you are getting off.  The bus conductor on board will collect the money directly from you so do prepare some small denomination.  The buses are old but well  equipped with powerful air-condition. These buses run every 10 minutes thus it is very convenient.As for going back to the Don Muang airport from the city,  it is much more easier.  Just take the BTS skytrain and stop at Mo Chit station.  Once you reached Mo Chit station, there are sign/direction showing you where to exit in order to catch the A1/A2 buses.  The signage and instruction here are very clear!!Have a wonderful time in Bangkok!!!"

        "review_text": "First off, I wrote the manager weeks ago, giving him a chance to respond before I ever considered writing this review, and never heard back from him, so I can see his concern for his customers means nothing.Secondly, my co-worker and I booked less than 24 hours apart, and she ended up paying double for her room.When she asked that they adjust the rate, or cancel her room, they were rude and indignant, as she had ended up booking a non refundable room(she hadn't realized it). They refused to help! So her rates were the same price as the Westin across the street.When we brought that up, we were told that we were given the benefit of free wifi and free breakfast, and would not get that at the Westin. Now, if you don't want coffee in your room, cold cereal, cold hard boiled eggs, and bad coffee for breakfast, in a little room for breakfast, stay here for your \"free breakfast\".Our water was luke warm in the showers, the rooms failed to heat up sufficiently, my room had a disgustedly dirty chair.We both travel for weeks at a time, every month. And are in SF often, as our manager is based here. This was our first and last time staying here.I would avoid this hotel.They are rude(except the sweet gal who checked us in late at night the first night, she really was nice!) But for $1200 for 2 nights, it was a sad and frustrating stay."

Thanks to Tripadvisor for that!!Friendly staff who answer your queries with a smile. Great location..this hotel has a shortcut which takes you to directly to the heart of the Pratunam Market. Pantip and Platinum mall is just across the road. So you can shop ...dump your goods at the hotel and shop again!! Central world and Paladium mall is also just across the corner. The Ratchathewi Skytrain Station is about 10 walk from the hotel and connects to Chatuchak Market via Mo Chit Station.The rooms are large and spacious and there's a 7/11 just outside the shortcut gate. They have a huge fridge...The breakfast spread was great. Going to miss their blueberry cheesecake!!The only issue we faced was the AC being freezing cold for the 1st day and while we wanted a room on the top floor ...all room were booked and we got the lowest level (level 5). :( However the soundproofing was well done so there were no problems.They also provide free Wi-Fi and the speed is quite good...The hotel is 10 min from Phaya Thai Skytrain Station (Airport Link) which connects the Airport and take around 40-50 baht by taxi and while going back we went to Ratchaprarop Station, a station before Phaya Thai which take around 30-40 baht by taxi.All in all a great experience. This would be my first choice for a hotel should I choose to visit Bangkok again.Thanks Centre Point!!!"

We went to a few other hotels, and the Outrigger Reef had the most relaxed feel to it. The room was very nice, and we had a great view of the ocean. The only reason I didn't rate this hotel higher is the horrible experience we had with the Wyndham timeshare people who operate out of the lobby. They were absolutely some of the most rude and obnoxious people I have ever encountered. I'm truly surprised that a hotel as nice as the Outrigger Reef allows them to use their hotel to conduct their shady business. My husband and I spoke to many other guests during our stay, and everyone had a similarly negative experience with the Wyndham staff. It's a shame, because we all otherwise really enjoyed our stay."

        "review_text": "This hotel surprised me - in an amazing way! I'm generally a four to five star, well known brand hotel kind of person. However with San Francisco being so expensive this was the best option. And what a fantastic surprise to find a clean hotel in a brilliant location.On arrival staff were extremely helpful and provided maps and lots of tips. Our room was big and clean and located towards the back of the building - we could even see the Golden Gate Bridge!The best thing about the hotel is location - the surrounding streets are full of restaurants and shops - it is brilliant - Chestnut and Union Streets in particular are perfect for wandering.You can also walk to both the Golden Gate Bridge, Fishermans Wharf and Union Square (although it's about an hour it's a lovely walk).I will definitely be staying here again when I come back to San Francisco!"

        "review_text": "NEVER NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!!!I stayed here mid June 2017.  Not only is the checking in experience horrible the staff is less than accommodating.  You walk into the hotel and have to go to the 11th floor to check in.  You then have to go across the hotel, outside through the courtyard, down some stairs, up some stairs, in another building, up more stairs, and finally into a non-airconditioned elevator to your room.  No bellboy volunteering to help you with your bags. The hotel itself is located in the ghetto.  You have to travel a min of 20 mins to get anywhere where you feel safe or comfortable.  To turn on the air conditioning you have to place your key in a slot to keep it on.  Fine...I get it.  But when I put on the Do Not Disturb sign, please do not come in my room and take the key out so the air conditioning turns off.  Rude.  When I complained they told me to calm down.  Plus our safe did not work.  They would not change our room or did they have a hotel safe.This is just a small sample of my complaints.  We literally gave up two nights here to stay in a different hotel across the city.Take your money elsewhere."

I joined the D club and got a players card and in 2 days racked up 90 bucks of free play. The hotel was nice and clean. While playing the slots the free drinks just kept coming almost faster than I could drink em. Great place to stay. We were on the 25th floor so no Freemont noise either"

        "review_text": "It\u2019s that time again: Family vacation. I recommended this resort because I previously stayed here, but like 7 plus years ago. Wow! This place is different. There\u2019s more buildings, a convenient shuttle that trolleys you to The Strip, and free parking. My Family owns a timeshare and exchanged it for a week here. We booked through RCI. This place is about $10 Lyft ride from the MGM. It\u2019s close to the major freeways and close to the airport. Through RCI we were confirmed a 2 bedroom upgrade. Upon check in, we were told that we would be put on a \u201cstand-by\u201d list. If there was an availability, they would let us know and to keep checking with the front desk. I know, it\u2019s the holidays. But the staff made it seem that we were going to get an upgrade. I hate being a bother and calling the front desk. I just don\u2019t like that the staff BS you and tell you it\u2019s going to happen when it\u2019s not. We arrived after 9pm and I called 3 hours before to let the resort know that we were running late. The staff said not to worry that the room will be ready. We arrive, and apparently we received a room with the parking lot view. It\u2019s on the first floor which means we hear lots of walking traffic. There\u2019s an extra sense of security because you practically need your room key for everything; including using the shuttle (the driver asks you for the room key). The first 2 nights our small refrigerator was making a sound. A loud shrieking sound. I called maintenance and they promptly came. They sprayed WD-40 and said everything was ok. Within the hour the noise was worse. The 2nd time they came they had a replacement refrigerator part in hand. Half ofMy family was at the pool area waiting for me. I couldn\u2019t go because maintenance was trying to resolve the problem. An hour or so passed and the refrigerator was still broken. Luckily, they brought another refrigerator. Since it\u2019s cold Fall weather, the pool wait staff is non-existent. I have to walk from the 5th building pool area all the way up to the restaurant and order drinks & continue my trek down. I\u2019m just glad the resort offers an Adult Only hot tub which is open 24/7. The pools are closed after 4pm. Outdoor barbecue grills is a plus too. The gym is very clean, good A/C and ventilated.For now, this is my review. My vacation is halfway completed. I will update my review when finished.."

        "review_text": "We travelled here as a family of 5 for a 10 night stay.  It was a hotel my husband had always wanted to stay at.  I did seriously consider the Moana Surfrider. Inthe end chose this iconic lady.After much deliberation we decided on the historic section.  As we require 2 rooms I emailed the hotel direct for their list of the various interconnecting options in the different room categories.  The hotel has a number of combinations which was excellent.We decided on a Garden Suite which interconnected with a garden room (with 2 doubles). The hotel does have a Garden Junior Suite so be aware of this when booking.  Whilst the normal rooms (both Garden and ocean view) are small our Garden Suite was huge.  We had a large king bedroom, an extra large lounge room and then the children had their own room.  As mentioned the normal rooms are on the small side and the bathroom is very tight so be mindful of this.  If your budget can stretch it, consider a Suite.  One thing to also note - both garden rooms and ocean view rooms in the historic section DO NOT have balconies, so if you like having a drink out on the balcony you won't be able to do that in these rooms.  This was probably the main thing I missed about the hotel.  In saying that the Mai Tai bar on the beachfront is fantastic for a sunset drink.  Our room was overlooking the garden (as opposed to the 'courtyard' or the Sheraton hotel next door).  It was beautiful, so green, peaceful and private.  Ask for rooms on this side if you can.We did have a look at the ocean view tower rooms whilst we were there and whilst the views are amazing, I feel they lacked the same atmosphere and feel of the historic rooms.  It's a personal preference.We are at the hotel for breakfast but opted for a la carte as the buffet was expensive I thought and the selection was very basic.Beach chairs and umbrellas are for rent each day but can cost up to $40 USD per day.  If you are staying for a length of time and know that this cost will add up - particulary if you are a family, take a trip to Walmart and buy some beach chairs, banana lounges and an umbrella and then just leave them behind or pass them on when you leave - it will save you $$.  The pool is small so you will find you probably will spend quite a lot of time on the beach.We had the most wonderful holiday ever!  The location (this particular section of beach has the best waves, it's also really wide) is perfect!  You will not find a better hotel in Waikiki.  The staff were lovely and I cannot recommended it enough.  We can't wait to return later in the year."

Room we had was a little bit small but had everything we needed. All the staff were friendly, polite and helpful. The price for the room was very reasonable, considering on its location. It's approx 200m from Asok BTS station and Sukhumvit MRT, which means it is has access to and from Suvarnabhumi airport and it's easy to go and see most attractions in Bangkok. Thoroughly enjoyed our 3 nights here."

The hotel is new and the view from reception is stunning!  Our room was beautifully appointed (a 1BR ocean view studio) with stunning views of Waikiki Beach from the spacious balcony which I loved waking up to.  The large, luxurious marble bathroom includes heated toilet seats and the gorgeous amenities we love.The staff were so warm and welcoming, and nothing was ever too much trouble.  They remembered it was my husband's 40th birthday and had arranged for a delicious fruit platter to be sent to our room both times we stayed here.  There's also a turn-down service with little personal touches.  Thank you Ritz-Carlton Residences at Waikiki Beach for such an amazing stay.  We will definitely be back!"

I've stayed at various hotels in Bangkok which are far newer than this one (Siam Kempinski, Hansar, Sukothai, Metropolitan, Peninsula).  The decor and especially the wood furniture is very old and dated.  Also I found that the room gets quite hot in the middle of the night as the air con seems to adjust itself to a lower mode.  Having said this, the service is excellent.  The hotel made a mistake with my airport return transfer and did everything to ensure that I made my flight home including having a hotel rep meet me at a convenient spot to take me to the hotel!"

Not expecting much, I was pleasantly surprised by the warmth of the hotel staff and the quietness of the hotel. I checked in fairly late, but the staff was alert and could sense what information I did and did not want (so their intro didn't go unnecessarily long as I was dying to get to my room after traveling). The rooms were fairly decent size, with a nice size desk and a very spacious bathroom. The windows were double-paned to keep out some of the street noise and the room stayed pretty quiet is sometimes hard to come by in a noisy city. I didn't try any of their food so I can't speak to that but they had a nice coffee bar in the morning. The lobby was small, and again quiet, which was nice when I had a co-worker meet me for some meeting prep. Due to the centralized location I would come back and stay here while on a personal trip."

I stayed in Building 2, where the bed, for me, was just too hard. Even after they provided me with 2 very thin pads it was too hard. An additional room shown to me in Building 2, as an option, had the same problem. While I realize bed hardness is an issue of personal preference, I ran into another couple  in Building 2 who had the same issue.So is the issue that there are harder beds in Building 2? Because I otherwise liked the hotel so much, I wrote to them a few months ago asking if there was a difference in beds between the two buildings, and they said no. So now, given the below post regarding being automatically placed in Building 2 with different(?) beds --when booking through a discounter--I am confused. I cannot figure out whether or not there are different levels of bed firmness available, and whether or not that is dependent on what Building you are in"

I highly recommend breakfast here, but there are also some bakeries/breakfast places 2 doors down.The Melrose is on a quiet block between Georgetown and Foggy Bottom.  It's a quick, short walk to shops and restaurants in one direction;  downtown, the White House and museums in the other.Being just a few blocks from the C&O canal dirt path and about a mile to the mall, it's a great spot for runners.  It's also close to 2 boat houses for kayaking. There is a pretty good fitness center too.I'm already scheming a return visit."

        "review_text": "Caveats:After reading through many reviews (after the fact), I\u2019m convinced that the difference between the \u201cnormal\u201d rooms and the suite rooms is vast in terms of room size and room smell, so keep that in mind with my review (I was in a normal King room). Also, my trip was Tuesday night through Friday morning, so I can only comment on weekday noises, etc. Lastly, I usually stay at the Monaco a few blocks away, so I can\u2019t help but compare the two. But given that they are at similar price points, I think this is fair. Based on my experience at the Alexis, even if I compare it to my \u201cworst\u201d stay at the Monaco, the Monaco is a much better hotel. I may even upgrade my Monaco review, if this is what the other alternatives are like. I travel to Seattle at least 4 times a year, and I will not be returning to the Alexis. I\u2019m putting the Alexis at a 2.5 but rounding down to a 2, given the hotel class, per-night price, and the fact that my clothes STILL smell more than 24 hours later.Room Size (King Room):Very close quarters! The room is long and narrow, so there is only about 18 inches between the bed and the walls. The bed has a 4-post metal frame, which is great in theory but if you\u2019re not used to it AND you don\u2019t have much clearance on either side, be prepared to have some close calls with hitting your head or other body part on it as you go around the corner to get into/out of bed. Because the room is long, the TV is on the wall opposite the bed (and there\u2019s a fair amount of floor space between the foot of the bed and said wall), so the TV is much further away than usual if you want to watch it from bed. Winner: Monaco, even if I pick the smallest room I\u2019ve ever stayed in.Room noise from the street:Pretty negligible, although because I stayed during the week I\u2019m sure the noises from the street and the hallway were less than they would be during the weekend. It\u2019s on 1st, right downtown, so don\u2019t stay here if things like sirens during the night would bother you. Winner: drawOther room noise:You can hear people above you walking around, something that I\u2019ve never experienced at the Monaco. Winner: MonacoHallway layout:This is where the Alexis has a huge leg up over other hotels, in my opinion. The floor is a half-hub-and-spoke model: you get off the elevators and are faced with 2 or 3 (I can\u2019t remember) hallways to go down. The hallways themselves wind around, which is great for noise control. Most hotels are really long hallways, which means that the sound carries easily. At the Alexis, the curvature of the hallway dampens some noise. Winner: Alexis, by far.Room smell:Like others on here have said, certain rooms (or floors) have extremely pungent smells. It smelled very musty, and I was embarrassed when I would go to the office every day, because my clothes smelled. 24 hours after leaving the hotel, my clothes still smell. You\u2019ve been warned. Winner: I have had one issue at the Monaco with smell, but it was a strong cigarette smell and they moved me quickly. Given the reviews it seems like the musty smell is ubiquitous at the Alexis, so I have to declare the Monaco the winner.Bathroom:Unlike at the Monaco, you can actually pump shampoo or conditioner into your hand without the shower head dripping on it! The water pressure leaves much to be desired, though. Otherwise the bathroom was fine. Winner: drawMisc room:Very limited outlets on one side of the bed. The other has an outlet/USB contraption which was nice, but that was it. The thermostat in the room will go down as far as 65, but somehow it senses when you\u2019re not in the room, so be prepared to come back to a warmer room than you\u2019d like. Fortunately, since the room was so small, it didn\u2019t take long to cool down. Each room has an umbrella (awesome) and a nice ironing board and iron, which is great for business travelers like me. Winner: drawWi-Fi:Very slow! I normally do video chat with my spouse when I\u2019m travelling on business, but it was just impossible on the Alexis network. So then I decided to try a wired connection. Umm no such luck, there was no Ethernet cord and the socket into which an Ethernet cord would have been inserted was completely missing from the holder! So I called the front desk. It took several minutes for the person who answered the phone to understand me (he had a thick accent)\u2026he kept trying to give me the Wi-Fi password. They finally sent someone up with an Ethernet cord, but it took the maintenance person quite a while to fix the connector thing. Once that was done, however, the connection was so spotty\u2014it was as if the connectors weren\u2019t working properly\u2014I gave up entirely and decided to use my precious data and video chat over LTE. Sigh. Winner: Monaco.Elevators:Fine, but sometimes really slow! Winner: Monaco (never any issues with slowness)Fitness rooms:There\u2019s a cardio room on the 4th floor and a climbing wall/weight lifting room on the 3rd floor. I don\u2019t think this is the most advisable layout, because then you have guests opening and closing the (noisy) doors to the fitness rooms, which I imagine would be disruptive (my room was far enough away). The cardio room has 2 treadmills and 2 ellipticals. I believe the Monaco is a much bigger hotel but its fitness room is the same size (and is always excruciatingly warm). Winner: AlexisRestaurant (Bookstore Bar):Cozy; I went for dinner alone on a weeknight and the waiter was attentive. The burger wasn\u2019t really anything to write home about, though. However, it\u2019s quieter than the Monaco restaurant and had better service. Winner: AlexisLobby:Definitely not as inviting as the Monaco, but it\u2019ll do. Winner: MonacoCoffee shop (Storyville):Not sure if they\u2019re affiliated with Alexis, but it\u2019s just outside their doorstep. Excellent lattes, delicious pastries, and very friendly staff. Winner: Alexis (there\u2019s a Starbucks next to the Monaco, but that just doesn\u2019t compare)General service:Meh. When I checked in, I wasn\u2019t given the normal spiel about what the hotel offers, etc. It was just \u201chere\u2019s your room number, have a good night.\u201d So I asked something like \u201cI normally stay at the Monaco, can you tell me a little bit about the hotel? Like is there a restaurant, etc.?\u201d So the woman at the desk told me about the restaurant\u2026but that was it. Nothing about the wine hour, the free bikes for rent, or the fitness center (I had to look at reviews online to determine whether there was one/where to find it!). [Yes, I could have called the front desk, too, but I was already miffed.] Winner: MonacoHotel location:Close to Pike Place Market, which is a plus. If you plan on going to, say, the public library on 4th, be prepared to walk up 3 very steep hills to get there. I absolutely don\u2019t knock the hotel for this, I just want fellow travelers to make an educated decision. Winner: for me, a draw (Monaco is closer\u2014and on flat terrain!\u2014to my office, but Alexis is closer to Le Panier and on flatter terrain).Other:The Kimpton Rewards program is great."

At first i had a very impatient person checking me in which was not a great start, eventually getting past that the remaining staff were very helpful and assisting. I stayed in a Junior Suite which was very spaces, clean, fresh and organised, the only really bad point was the poor TV channels and signal, only used the TV briefly on a rainy evening. The wifi is excellent and fast which is always pleasing for tourists. the breakfast buffet options could have been slightly better but otherwise not bad. Rooftop pool and area is very relaxing as is the lobby downstairs. I can honestly say that when i return to Bangkok, I will definitely stay here again"

        "review_text": "I realise that San Francisco is one of the world's most expensive places to stay, but I couldn't help but feel a little hard done by what I got for my money in a two day stay in a double room. I was assigned one of the smallest rooms in the building (I think 431), and it was tiiiiny: barely room for luggage for one person, let alone two. There were also scuff marks across the walls, a missing tap, a cracked toilet seat and no writing desk, which ended up being quite a hassle for a business trip.That said, the hotel itself is beautiful, and I greatly enjoyed the free afternoon wine and cheese. It's also in a great location, and things felt reasonably safe when walking around the area (particularly heading north from the hotel). Overall I would recommend Nob Hill, but feel some work could be done bringing the smaller rooms up to an acceptable standard."

We returned at 4pm, they still did not have a room ready for us.

        "review_text": "We stayed here for 4 nights and it was a really wonderful experience. The hotel lobby is on the 24th floor of a very new building and it just oozes luxury and refinement when you get in. It is a Japanese hotel and is relatively minimalistic compared to some higher end western chains and I definitely appreciated the simple yet luxurious atmosphere.Room - our room was on the 32nd floor and had a nice view of the city. The bed is huge and very comfortable. There are a couple different types of pillows on the bed and we didn't know until later but the service book has additional pillow options made of different materials as well. The rain shower was nice and all bathrooms including the ones in the lobby have Japanese warmed seats and can spray water.Service - the service everywhere was impeccable. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The turn down service is great and they leave a few sheets of origami on the bed every night with instructions on how to make a crane.Food - the included breakfast is amazing. The buffet is extensive (ex multiple types of honies, American foods, European cold cuts/breads, Asian foods) and everything I tried was good. There is also an \u00e0 la carte menu that is free to order from. The French toast is some of the best I have ever had. We also had a snack one afternoon including the signature pappardelle with beef and it was delicious and not very expensive. Definitely a nice place to take a break and relax after sight seeing.Pool/Gym - we only used the pool once. It is pretty small but nice to hang out for a bit. They serve food and drinks. The pool has an ok view - nothing spectacular but it's an infinity pool which is cool. We didn't use the gym but it looked to be a good setup.Location - the hotel is right next to the Chit Phloen BTS station so it was very convenient to get there from the airport. I thought it would be easier to get everywhere with the BTS/MRT but it really wasn't so we ended up taking taxis/tuk tuks to and from the hotel. It's not close to most stuff but you can get a taxi ride to most major attractions within 15-20 minutes and it's not too expensive (100 bhat or less). The hotel is also across from Central Embassy which is a high end mall. It is pleasant to take a stroll through and there are several nicer chain restaurants like Din Tai Fung inside. It is super convenient to grab a bite to eat if you don't want to go far and there is also a grocery store in the basement. We tried out the Embassy Cineplex while we were there as you can get a big couch bed in the theatre (definitely a cool experience if you haven't tried it before).All in all, no complaints about the hotel. I would very likely stay there again and the only reason I wouldn't is to be in a more central location (ex Silom) but it was really a very nice experience at the Okura."

If you\u2019re expecting that, then you\u2019ll be happy with this hotel. The breakfast is decent, the gym is ok (but avoid the smelly and disused steam room), and the rooms are big enough. However, my \u201cnon-smoking room\u201d had an ashtray and cigarette burns in the stained carpet, the elevator is indeed slow and the check in and checkout processes do take forever. I could also hear the elevator pinging all night from my room. So all in all I wouldn\u2019t recommend the place, not for this price anyway, but if it was cheaper it would be a decent budget hotel."

The front desk lady rang us when our room was ready so we came back at 1100-the room was amazing. Level 16 with ocean views. The room itself was very neatly appointed, roomy with a large TV, compact ensuite and plenty of storage for our bags and things.There is a travel agent-bookings desk downstairs-they were very helpful and honest about activities to do for us to get the most out of our holiday.The hotel itself is very central, a block away from the Dukes statue-where there is a bus stop for the tourist trolley's right next to the beach and bath areas. Restaurants and bars everywhere, walking distance to everything in the Waikiki beach front area.The food in the restaurant/bar area was not very good and way overpriced. Breakfast box unappetising apart from the fruit. Coffee machine in the room was a nice touch and coffee not too bad either.The bar at the pool was the same. The bar tender was swearing with some of the lads at the bar-very unprofessional and inappropriate Chad.The pool area is lovely. The cabanas looked perfect was very expensive to hire, and I didn't quite understand why you had to hire pool lounges in the pool itself. Spa was warm-great views of the ocean between the buildings.I would definitely stay here again. Front desk staff were so helpful and nice and made things easy for us to sort out."

        "review_text": "I've been staying at the Narai regularly for some 30 years, and have been a great fan of it. Now, unfortunately, I am less enthusiastic, since it seems pricey for it's quality. On the plus side, the breakfast buffet is just about the best that I've ever come across in an equivalent hotel.At reception, one young member of staff was very friendly and helpful, but two older and more-senior receptionists were inattentive and then downright rude. First impressions are important, and the management ought to review it's choice of reception staff or retrain them to be polite, smiling and helpful.At the swimming pool, I wanted to order food and drinks, but there was hardly ever anyone there with whom to do so. This contrasts with previous years.As a result, I looked for and found another hotel (with a suite at a price only just over half that charged by the Narai for a standard room), and switched to it after two nights."

        "review_text": "Came in late from an overseas flight and just needed something close to the airport as we were leaving in AM for an outer island.  This hotel was one step up from sleeping on a park bench.  The only positive thing was a prompt pick up from airport.  Other than that, we were in a third floor room in what was an old decrepit looking building with no elevator.  We had four bags with us from a month long cruise which had to be manhandled up stairs.  The room was Spartan.  A bed, a desk and nothing more.  On top of that, there was no soap or other toiletries and it required a 11:00 PM visit to desk so we could wash.  AC was noisy and room was old and dirty looking.  We didn't even want to set luggage on floor.  Couldn't wait to leave in AM and get to airport for coffee. Would not even consider eating anything here.  If you want a basic bed and nothing more, this is your place.  We should have gone into town and had a decent room and a decent nights sleep."

Although I never heard any noise I could see the results of the work.It seems they are trying to retain a lot of the original look and I hope they can.There is no air conditioning although during our 2 night stay it was quite warm enough even with a window open. The stair wells have open windows also and the fresh air is welcomed by my wife - an asthmatic."

        "review_text": "It will NOT be my last time staying at the W. My trip was to visit family and to experience Restaurant Week. The service from the time I walked into the W until the time I left was stupendous! As a SPG member, I appreciated that they took into account my requests from my profile: high floor, near the elevator. The front desk,the restaurant for breakfast, and room service was great. There was no coffee pot in the room, but a phone call took care of that in about 10 minutes.The bed as usual at all of the SPG locations I have visited was great. I slept like a baby. As for location, perfect. The bar service and the comfort of the lounge area, wonderful. I look forward to visiting again soon."

        "review_text": "I've been staying regularly at the Waldorf in Chicago for the past few years, and up until now have been very happy with the hotel (see my previous reviews dated 8/21/14 and 3/19/13).  The hotel had been the  Elysian hotel until it was purchased in 2011 by an investor who chose Hilton  to manage it under the Waldorf brand.This time, though, service was disappointing.  The first day, housekeeping completely overlooked my room, despite the fact that I had turned on the maid request light when I left at 7:30 a.m.   When I returned at the end of the day, the room had not been cleaned and the light was still on.  Wouldn't you know it, though, on the morning I checked out, a maid knocked on the door at 8:30 a.m. to clean the room just as I was getting out of the shower.  Didn't housekeeping know that I hadn't checked out yet?My room service breakfast was 20 minutes late.  Granted, that's not a life or death matter, but it's definitely not the service level that a hotel of this price and quality should provide.Front desk staff seemed inexperienced and flustered by my special requests.The hotel is still a very nice property with attractive rooms and marble bathrooms with a separate, large soaking tub.  The location is very convenient to Michigan Ave. shops and restaurants.  I hope the service problems I experienced were a fluke.  If I decide to stay there again, I'll let you know what I find."

        "review_text": "Honolulu, that is Waikiki Beach, the Times Square of the heart of Hawaii, can be a mess, especially those who just got off the plane with a travel brochure and luggage larger than they are. This is just as difficult for any seasoned TA visitor: just which part of such a melting pot are we writing to? My personal favorite has always been the classic Victorian grand hotel, the Surfrider, which has survived both a few changes of management and even the beach hordes on its gracious steps. Clearly, many of its contemporary clientele (who may think that a luau shirt qualifies as dinner dress), this is no fault of a magical legend of early Hawaii trying to survive the ages. So this review is happy to report to all those travelers of such different stripes that the Surfrider has managed its own time-fold ways to satisfy most of you. It's up to you top know how to navigate the rest.The simplest customer is simply the bargain-hunting beachcomber. If all they need is a mattress, a beach and an all-day bar, it's all at the best spot for surf and trade winds; that's why they built it here a century ago in the first place. But for the more fastidious (or nostalgic) travelers, the royal Surfrider can still show its regal side, even if it's a bit more difficult to find. The original wing's floors, each of which was built from Banyan or a different wood, has been carpeted over, but the luscious open-air  breezeways remain across its lobby and terraces; from the entrance to the courtyard, the gentle wood rocking chairs are still in place. If you're drawing comparisons to the other original beach palace, the Royal Hawaiian, all bathed in sunrise pink, in my opinion, it has been submerged beneath a seat of upscale mall shops.The Surfrider, of course, has now added new wings to the original, some smaller, warren rooms requiring a hike to the nearest elevator, but here's where a little advance scouting helps: the reservations, concierge, baggage and customer service desks are all impressively loyal and personally attentive; you may even forget there are hundreds there beside you. Room and housekeeping service are just as responsive: a room can be cleaned up, on request, within an hour or so, and empty trays are picked up before you even notice. The range of rooms, from classic verandahs and plantation shutters to suites with beach and city balconies, are available, but require going through a maze of advance scouting, worthy of some resort paleontology. They can all be found, up to your preference and your budget, but buyer beware: don't leave it up to online reservations.Finally, the hotel's spa and fitness center are all updated and the best that can be found this side of Eden. You will also find a young and athletic crowd present, maybe a surprise to find them sharing the same historic and romantic hotel that you are. Best of all, the Surfrider's open-air, Oceanside, verandah restaurants for breakfast and dinner are literally in a different space and price point from the bar menus, but in the evening their sense of peace and old Hawaii tides and breezes may remind you that the calming ancestors of Waikiki are still there with you.One non-property warning: the local taxi drivers can be notoriously ill-mannered and poorly trained (mine couldn't understand the directions to Waikiki or the Surfrider. Arrange beforehand for hotel shuttle or service to collect you."

        "review_text": "Stayed at the Cosmo on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday. Here are some of the pros/cons:Pros:-Free parking for hotel guests-Bath robe/Slippers-They have an iPad in the room. You can use it for servicing, or you can use it to control the lights (but you can still turn off the lights manually if you choose)-The view was amazing. I think they must have upgraded us or something. We didn't pay for a view of the strip but we were at a great angle. They even asked if we wanted a higher floor. From our room, you can see most of the south strip, including the Bellagio fountain. That was nice to watch from the comfort of the room-You can check out via mobile-Location is great - it\u2019s kind of in the middle of the strip. No matter what hotel you stay at in Vegas, you\u2019ll be doing a lot walking, so better that this is in the center-There\u2019s a mini fridge in the room. I\u2019m not talking about a minibar (which they also have if you like overpaying for stuff), but one for personal useCons:-Hallways are dark and a bit creepy-The actual rooms look pretty basic. Not sure when they last renovatedOverall had a great stay. Not sure I\u2019d stay here again, but only because I\u2019d want to check out other hotels."

        "review_text": "What to do when you have a lay over or an early check out and your plane is leaving late in the evening? You can first go to the airport to store your luggage there for 25$ to 30$ per suitcase. Or go to pier 39 visitor centre for 5$ per bag, but they aren't directly connected to BART. Because of security reasons most hotels will not store your luggage when you don't stay there. We took a day room at Mossers (check in 9:00 am, check out 18:00 pm) (use hotelsbyday.com) left our luggage during the day and could freshen up in our little room with shower before going to the airport. The hotel is perfect located near union square and public transport. The rooms are small but clean and comfortable."

        "review_text": "This place pretends to be a luxury hotel, while offering substandard rooms, service and amenities.  You are better off stating at a Hilton, Marriott or Westin.  The check-in staff was awful.  I arrived at nearly midnight and was told that the king bed room I reserved was not available unless I wanted to pay extra.  As I took out my smartphone, the desk agent realized I would be slamming the hotel with a negative review and eventually gave me a room with a king bed.  The room looked straight into an office building.  The room was comparable to any business hotel and nothing special.  The hotel pool is a small lap pool in the basement.  Do not trust the professional photos.  The service in the restaurant at breakfast was pretty awful.  They decided to reorganize and refill the sugar holder at my table while I was eating.  The only dining option was the breakfast room.  Unless you have an amazing rate, you are better off elsewhere.  I have stayed at other Fairmont properties and enjoyed my stays.  This hotel is not well run, and is coasting on the high demand for DC hotel rooms."

        "review_text": "Villa Florence is a hotel full of character and certainly one that draws upon the modern and esoteric elements of the city of San Francisco. From the larger-than-life ostrich poised in front of a tangerine quilted backdrop to The excellent handmade cocktails cert every night during happy hour from 5 to 6 PM in the lobby bar, there are little touches hear that could make this hotel great.The rooms are a decent size given the very central location and price points for the hotel. We had a twin room which comfortably since two double beds; there is also a separate built-in wardrobe that also stores a very large suitcase. The bathroom is indeed very small but Squeezin a full-size both type as well as a shower, toilet and sink. It is certainly a bathroom the only allows for one person at a time.The room is warm, the Wi-Fi is first, the TV is large and perfectly functional and there is a well-stocked minibar available. The lighting in our room was largely artificial as the windows have French shutters that restrict the light and, in any event, the room only faced onto a wall of other rooms in the hotel. If you enjoy natural light that you may want to ask for a room that specifically looks out onto the street if this is available. I sense that originally this is somewhat of an older hotel as the rooms are not exactly soundproof; I could hear each time someone above me was moving as well as people walking up and down the corridor in front of the room. If you are a light sleeper this is something that you want to take into consideration when staying here.At the time of this review, TripAdvisor does not mention that there is a fitness centre or gym here. Indeed there is one available on the second floor which is a decent size and thoughtfully equipped. I have certainly been to worse gyms in larger hotels with fancier brand names.The location speaks for itself. Union Square is surrounded by some of the best shopping in San Francisco and you are within striking distance of Chinatown, market Street, SOMA and of course the BART. There is also a handy Walgreens moments from the hotel that also stocks decent breakfast items and snacks.The staff there are quite friendly and more than happy to help out and ensure that you have a great experience. This was evident from the check in with the chatty reception who was keen to let us know what was in the area. The bartender in the evenings certainly holds his own chatting with everyone at the bar while making drinks.When I come back here and stay again? The hotel has a lot to offer and given the relatively modest price points for the location, it is indeed hard to beat. The reception told us that at the time of checking in and therefore at the time of this review, the hotel have just taken on a new management within the last week. To that end, if the new management can make adjustments to modernise elements of the hotel (including some soundproofing) whilst retaining the idiosyncrasies, the service quality and price point: this hotel would be an excellent stay."

        "review_text": "I made a reservation online for this hotel and it was clearly not very occupied as most hotels aren't in January.   I reserved a Waldorf suite and was checking in on the app and was upgraded to an Astoria Suite.  I was preassigned a room and unable to change it after having called numerous times to request the capability to choose my room and denied this request without a reason being given.  I was given room 2210. The room looked like it was surprised.  The paint was scratched, the carpets were discolored, there was dust everywhere and it looked disheveled.  I called to ask if another room was available and after a lot of prodding and looking I asked to upgrade again thinking the WA rooms were pretty crappy for 650/night.   I upgraded to a luxury suite.  And there wasn't a single one ready or available according to Dana.   So she sent someone to clean one.  And this is what I got when I finally, two hours later, got into the room.  A disgusting heap of blood spattered curtains, weird gross mold in the bathroom and an empty shell of a room that didn't even bother to have working lights.   Foul foul foul.   I will never bother with WA Chicago.   Don't waste your time or your money."

When I pointed out this mistake to the hotel management to see if they would refund the $1,730 dollars they had charged me for no-shows, I was basically told \"too bad, your mistake, we'll refund 1 of them and only 50% of the other.\"Mind you, I'm a platinum member who developed a contract with this hotel for my team to spend hundred of nights there over the past year.  They have made thousands and thousands of dollars from us and yet they can't seem to overlook a mistake that will cost me $450 because of an oversight.Given my experience with them, I have cancelled all future reservations with them and would advise any experienced travelers to avoid this place like the plague...it's not worth the hassle.

        "review_text": "Firstly, I would like to say that this hotel is amazing and we have really enjoyed our stay here. The service was great and our room was clean fresh and staff were always welcoming! If I can make some points that was a little disappointing in the hope that next time we come back it won't still be a problem. 1) the pool closes at 6pm!!! Really? If children are the problem then maybe they can be either accompanied by an adult after 6 or simply no children after 6. Spending a night shopping and then a nice cool swim to relax all those muscles in your arms and legs is surly a good way to retire for the night. A hotel of this great standard should have a pool that is open well after 6pm.2) Totally understand the requirements for members of the public to come on site, however, this can be managed a lot better then it currently is. We pay top dollar to use the facilities each day, and on some occasions we were unable to get a seat in either the pool area or the open area.Again, none of these two points will deter me from staying at this hotel again, as I think it is absolutely amazing, however, please finds this comments as constructive.Thanks for the great memories!"

Highly recommended for stay in waikiki. Morning breakfast is basic but wholesome. Plenty of options and the omelet option is very popular. Evening drinks at the pool is a highlight. Kids can play in the pool while you can have a drink."

        "review_text": "This review is well overdue as hubby and I stayed here for the last few nights of our honeymoon a few years ago. We had a partial ocean view room overlooking the pool below. The bathroom was one of the best we have used in a hotel room and the bed was so comfortable. The grounds and hotel itself are absolutely stunning and very quiet all throughout. This was particularly nice around the pool area, with no diving allowed, etc. We were so impressed with the quality and variety of the buffet breakfast! Service was fantastic and we ordered an early breakfast to our room the night before we left to catch an early flight and were impressed by the quality of food and punctuality it was delivered. A very pricey hotel but was beautiful for our honeymoon stay!!"

        "review_text": "The GF had never been downtown, so this trip I decided to not only take her but get a hotel room down there. I opted for the Fremont, as it is centrally located for the evening's festivities.The price was fair all things considered. They had a nice buffet where we had ate breakfast. The price in line with most Vegas buffets for earlier in the day. The room was very basic. The bathroom small with no counter space. When we walked in from the 110 outside, the room was very hot. So it took some time for it to cool down once we put on the AC full blast eventually getting there middle of the night where we stopped sweating. The cable package was minimum, they want you downstairs gambling.The location is right on Fremont Street, so if that is what you came down here for, you are in the middle of the action. This is a smaller casino, but it has that old school \"charm\" if you like that compared to the strip.We were on the 14th floor, which was for non-smokers, and it was loud at times with all of the weekend nighttime noise. However, we were so tired we passed out and it was only an issue at the beginning. The service was fast and friendly at the bell and front desk."

        "review_text": "We checked into the Moana yesterday, where we will be spending 9 days. My husband is an SPG platinum and has been for 9 years. He spends as many nights in hotels as he does at home, if not more and I spend at least 10 nights a month in hotels, so when we travel for vacation we expect to be as comfortable as we are when we travel for business and we like to use those SPG platinum benefits. Well, not at the Moana Westin.They gave us a room that they say was 2 upgrades from the standard room, and what I can say is that the room in no way meets any standard for an ordinary 5-star hotel, luxury collection or Starwood 6 level. Sure, the view is nice, but that wasn't provided by the Westin - that's Hawaii. What that wonderful view cannot change, is that the closet - with no door - is actually INSIDE the bathroom. Yes, that's correct, there is no proper closet. There's a place for you to hang your clothes in the same room (with no window and poor ventilation) that you use to shower and do other things that will not keep your clothes fresh. We are here for a wedding and will be hanging a tuxedo and gown there ... and this \"fantastic, 2 upgrade\" room is not the only one designed this way. The bathroom is so small that you could actually get water on your clothes from brushing your teeth at the sink. Not only that, the amenities in the room are pitiful. I just got back from staying in a 3 star hotel in Napa Valley and they had a Keurig coffee maker in the room - not here. You can expect those old-fashioned coffee makers from the '90s. 3 weeks ago we were at the Westin in Rome, and these two places are night and day.My husband spent 2 hours (instead of enjoying this amazing place!) on the phone with the SPG Platinum desk, and they could do NOTHING to help. That's what is sad - it means that this is actually what they consider a good room. Starwood and SPG take note; this hotel should not be considered your category 6! Now I would really worry about what a standard room is like.On top of all of this, I care immensely about Hotels' environmental policies and sat at the pool bar for lunch yesterday where, after telling him 3 times, the barman continued to leave a faucet open full force with water going at least 5 gallons a minute. We come from California where there is a water shortage, and Hawaii has one too! Not for this place, no one at the bar was even phased by this. On top of that, unless these cups are compostable (and I do not see any composting bins), there are plastic cups all over the place, and no one from the hotel bothers to go out to the beach and clean them up. Putting a recycle bin in our room and not changing linens cannot make up for the waste in other areas.What I can say is that so far the people servicing have been very nice, so at the end of our stay I will complete my review with any other details we pick up in the 9 days and of course will add positive reviews for the people who provide excellent service.Anyway, today we are hunting for 2 rooms (we have 2 rooms!!) someplace else so let's hope that the beach and beauty of Hawaii - and a better accommodation make up for the rest of our stay."

        "review_text": "This hotel is fantastic, spacious rooms, great staff, awesome views, fantastic pool. It's at the quiet end of Waikiki, just across the road from the beach and the Waikiki wall. The staff are super friendly and helpful, I arrived at 0730 and wasn't looking forward to hanging around all day waiting to get into my room - but my room was ready. They do offer a hospitality room so you can shower and access to the pool if your room isn't ready. The hotel houses three eateries all good and is in easy walking distance of many more. Travelling alone I always felt safe during my stay and was greeted on return each day inquiring about how my day had gone.  The lobby also houses a tour company that are fantastic at organizing all sorts of tours and activities. You do need to be aware that quite a lot of O'ahu's homeless hang around the Starbucks and ABC stores trying to beg money or cigarettes - but the Police will quickly move anyone being a pest along and at no time did I feel unsafe. They will also provide a Kettle if you want. The room was quiet even though close to the elevators and the bed was super comfy."

        "review_text": "I initially booked three nights at the hotel at the government rate of 267.00, but my company changed my plans several days before arriving to the hotel. I called the hotel and they wouldn\u2019t change my reservation for the same price even though they are a Guaranteed Fed rate hotel and under contract with the government. When I arrived, I told them I would only be staying one night. The front desk said they would charge me a full nights stay for canceling at the last minute. The hotel is under contract with my company and we have a 6: pm cancellation policy and I was in the hotel standing at the front desk st 3:00 pm.I had to make numerous phone calls back to my travel agency who in turn called the hotel. My travel agency spoke to the manager, Lori Ann who said she would personally take care of it and that they could not charge me any additional fees.Next morning when I went to check out they still tried to charge me an additional 276.00 cancellation fee. Numerous more phone calls but finally they took the charge off. Horrible experience and I feel like the hotel was a total scam. Front desk folks were unprofessional, rude and not helpful at all. I would never ever stay there again!!"

        "review_text": "I stayed here two nights with my family in early December. Check in was smooth, if less than friendly. The room was fairly large and clean. It was also quiet even though we were fairly close to the road - I'm not sure why so many people complain about the noise...The breakfast was about what you would expect for the price - edible, but not much more. The two miniscule areas for eating were extremely crowded, and the amount of warm food was inadequate for the number of people staying in the hotel.The service was poor / average - all three people I encountered at the front desk clearly care little about their job. The young woman was hands down the worst - her attitude bordered on rude. I doubt the management ever reads these reviews, but if they do, they need to do a much better job with training and supervising their front desk staff.Ultimately, it was a decent stay. Not bad, but not great.Oh, and two tips for people staying here:  there are a few good, family-friendly restaurants across the street (be careful when crossing the street - the traffic is dangerous). Also, the gift shop at the hotel next door (Holiday Inn?) is a great place to stock up on snacks, drinks, etc. and even buy a few souvenirs."

        "review_text": "The location of the Palomar is excellent. It gives you the ability to explore Michigan Ave as well as River North easily. There is ample parking in the area by using one of the parking apps like parkwiz or from the hotel valet. It is an easy walk or cab ride to so much of the city from this location that it makes it ideal for just about anyone.The rooms are spacious and comfortable. I was in a king city view, room 1125. The bed was comfortable with nice bedding and pillows. The room also provided a nice sitting area that looked over the city. The dresser and large closet allowed me to easily unpack and the desk space provided with ample working ability. The bathroom was large and well appointed.The Kimpton's offer a wine happy hour in the lobby which is always nice. It seems that many of the guests come down for that. The restaurant in the hotel is very good for breakfast with friendly service and excellent food. The egg white scramble was excellent as was the breakfast tacos. At night the restaurant also had a nice vibe and was a great place to get drinks with friends.The service was friendly and helpful. The staff always had a smile and a hello. If something was needed they seemed more then willing to assist. This included a very early check-in on the day of arrival which was a fantastic perk for me.Highly recommend."

Everyone greets you with a smile and are available everywhere to help you if you need anything! I really was blown away by the staff and facilities, Buffet breakfast was very good too, although leaning more towards Asian food, it was still very good. I even tried some strange juice combinations that were pretty good. I would definitely stay here again.....although I would probably wait until the roads and access to the main road Sheik Zaid got better,as if you are driving your own car it us a bit difficult to maneuver to get here. Overall it was an excellent experience! The only negative comment I would have was there was a very loud party going on by the pool ( the music was blaring with loud bass music ) and I could hear it after  10 pm from the 18th floor in the middle of the week! But I would still return here!"

After several days of complaints, we were moved to an upgraded suite. This was definitely a better room and had hot water. A business associate on a different floor never did have hot water.I know the majority of Waikiki hotels charge a resort fee, as does Ohana. I don't see the justification of this and it appears to me to be a way to appear to have a lower daily charge then add on fees.Overall, again, the overall pricing made it cost-effective for a business stay (14 days), with a fridge and microwave. The front desk personnel were friendly and responsive and the rooms were clean. These factors definitely weigh in my judgment. I'd consider this a decent value for a couple days spent in Waikiki."

Great food.-My wife loved her spa treatment-Filtered water from the large fridge in the kitchen-Huge bathroom with whirlpool tub-Very romantic.  Would stay again.-$12 Uber from airport-Room rates much lower compared to the strip.  Less crowded too.  It would be a great home base for a large group.Cons-  No casino.  Probably not a con for most folks, but I like to gamble.-Only 1 restaurant, but lots and lots close by.  Go to Ellis Island for cheap BBQ or Steak special in the diner.  It is next door and literally a 1 min walkI would stay again as a romantic trip with my wife or if I was attending a convention.  Close to the Las Vegas Convention Center and walking distance to the Sands Convention Center.On your walk to the strip, go inside of The Westin.  Classy place with low limit gambling.  Stop in The Stage Door Casino for a $2 Corona.  Seedy place, but why not.  Next stop, the strip."

A few days ago, I made a reservation knowing that I may need to cancel. The booking page said FREE CANCELLATION! everywhere, which is the only reason I moved ahead with the reservation. Alas, I did need to cancel the following morning, and was promptly charged the full price of the room. Apparently FREE CANCELLATION! only applies if cancelled more than three days before the stay, and since I booked my reservation only two days before, I was always outside the window. \u201cOkay,\u201d I thought, \u201cI am a flawed human being who does not dig deep in Terms & Conditions when FREE CANCELLATION! is advertised as a selling point, but I\u2019m sure the hotel will be reasonable about this since the booking page was rather misleading, and I only held the reservation for a few hours.\u201dNot so much. The manager Bill restated the error of my ways, and was even kind enough to send me a link to the fine print with their cancellation policies. Helpful! Finally Bill agreed that if he were able to rebook my room, I would be refunded the cancellation fee. Just to make this point extra clear to me, he followed up in an email stating, verbatim, \u201cAs I mentioned earlier, if we are able to sell the room tonight, I will refund the cancellation fee.\u201dSo there I am, checking the booking page periodically, hoping my room will book when\u2014lo and behold\u2014it books! Hurrah!The next morning I\u2019m feeling pretty good and I give Bill a call to finalize my refund. \u201cOh no,\u201d he says, \u201cI said if the hotel SELLS OUT we will refund your room.\u201d Hmm\u2026 nope, I actually have this email from you that says otherwise. \u201cNo no,\u201d Bill says, \u201cI said we\u2019d need to sell out.\u201d And that\u2019s that!To make matters worse, they overcharged me by $40 by including tax when I was only supposed to be charged the room rate for cancellation. Booking.com has been arguing this point with them on my behalf, but the Burnham is digging in. Apparently this marginal sum is more important to them than losing my\u2014and anyone who will listen\u2019s\u2014business for life."

        "review_text": "We are just wrapping up a disappointing two night stay here. The hotel is extremely dated and under-provisioned, so much so that when we checked in they recommended we use the pool at the neighboring Sheraton Waikiki as well as the gym there. Even at reception they wouldn\u2019t recommend their own facilities!Rooms are dated, musky and dimly lit. Simple as that.Service was very mediocre and a poor, indifferent attitude from nearly everyone we interacted with. I don\u2019t understand what makes this a \u201cLuxury Collection\u201d hotel when (and I am SPG Gold) they weren\u2019t able to check me into my room until after 4pm. Possibly the worst experience was trying to access the pool and when we couldn\u2019t find a chair we visited the beach - only to be told that chairs are $40 per person BUT that they were sold out for the next few days so we were out of luck. To add insult to injury, there is only one pool at the Sheraton we are allowed the access (the other requires wrist bands) and it was the overcrowded kids pool with...you guessed it...no available seats.This cannot be emphasized enough - in Hawaii at the Royal Hawaiian - two hotel guests could not be accommodated with space at the pool OR at the beach, irrespective of an absurd additional charge levied on guests for chairs (and in addition to the mandatory $37 nightly resort fee...which covers what exactly if I\u2019m not using the gym, pool or beach at the hotel?)It can rain often in Hawaii and this \u201cLuxury Collection\u201d hotel doesn\u2019t stock umbrellas in guest rooms - so when it rained all day yesterday and I asked for an umbrella I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when they said they were all out.Finally, when I asked for the late checkout option as an SPG Gold...you guessed it... also out of the question.This hotel is leveraging a historic past to milk guests of money and reinvest zero back into the property or service. I haven\u2019t been this disappointed by a hotel in a long time. Would very strongly recommend you look elsewhere - there is a ton of other nicer, newer, better-serviced room capacity up and down the block here in Waikiki."

Did I mention the waitress there is the best you could ask for ? I reserved two rooms and when we checked in we we're given a upgrade. What a pleasant surprise. The rooms also had an adjoining door which was perfect for our family. The rooms were clean and neat and plenty of room. A refrigerator would've been a nice addition. The hotel has a comedy/magic show \"Mike Hammer\" it was well worth the money. He had the audience participate in the show and keep the crowd laughing the whole time. Great job Mike.The hotel is located close to the local bus stops, which we utilized to make our daily trip to the strip. It was a lot easier to figure out then we had first thought. I would definitely stay here again."

Your neighbors, the elevator, the street noise, construction 3 blocks away. And I was on the top floor.There was construction but that didn't bother me- I knew about it in advance. I didn't actually hear anything from hotel construction during the day b/c of my high floor I assume (others noted complaints).I was told that I'd receive a food voucher of $30 because the lounge was closed but was told when I arrived that it wasn't possible and I'd receive points. It's not the points vs voucher that mattered as the change in the story.Bed was also wasn't that comfortable.If you want a cheaper hotel that still has the higher end feel- then this is a decent stop. But I've been in Chicago for a month now and I won't be back. The other Marriotts are much better in comparison."

Mine, for instance, is above a garage and the door opens at all hours of the night and especially in the morning. It is loud enough to wake you up. There is no warning of this. The room isn\u2019t cheaper than its counterparts despite its clear problems. Every day you\u2019re woken up at 6:30 or so by the constant opening and closing of the garage door. Never again. Crap room, crap hotel. Either warn your guests or don\u2019t rent out the room. People like good sleep at hotels."

        "review_text": "At first glance this place looks cool, interesting design and good location. My wife booked it after seeing it on a travel show in Australia. I think this is quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The first night we checked in to a room that someone had vomited in and the cleanup had involved a few litres of bleach which was all we could smell when we checked in. Anyway we moved to another room the next day with a blind that had a 12 inch rip in it repaired with staples and electrical tape, top job! Bathroom was mouldy in the shower and had several holes in the wall where shelves had fallen off and not been replaced. There was paint and wallpaper scuffing everywhere you looked. So in summary if you love staying in a place where maintenance and cleaning staff are on constant holiday and the staff are just over it, this ones for you!!Wish I\u2019d taken a couple of photos to show how lovely it was. Not."

The sign for valley said it was $55/ night if you were staying with the hotel. What they don't tell you is that when you check out they add extra into the bill making it $75! When we got into the lobby the staff member said he needed to charge for incidentals of $114. It said no such thing online and the only card I remembered that day didn't have that much, I just had cash. We had to wait hours in the lobby for our friends to come and join us and pay the incidentals, he wouldn't even let us pay cash. The snarky employee didn't offer us to go to our room yet we waited around on Christmas Day in their hotel lobby.  By not making it clear of the incidental fee online and having the vallet up charge so much, I will not be coming back."

        "review_text": "Stayed here with my boyfriend for what was suppose to be a start of a relaxing valentines weekend. Both of us had no idea about the stories surrounding the hotel, but because we both love history and vintage places, we considered staying here. The rooms were super dated. The carpet was shabby. The amenities were horrible and the bathroom was just terrible. The front desk agent who checked us in did not seem friendly at all. She actually seemed bored. When we got to our room, we both were surprised to see how the condition of the place was just horrific so we decided to pull out and check under the covers of the bed if it was actually cleaned well (because the state of the room seemed otherwise) thankfully, it was. We were playing music in the room, mind you it was not too loud too, but maybe after 30 mins, somebody actually slammed their fist twice on our door. Maybe it was an angry guest next door or something.  But it was still highly rude!! During the middle of the night we could hear the couple next door audibly doing the dirty!!!! Walls were as thin as paper! This added to the whole unappealing stay. I suggest picking somewhere else to stay if you wanna relax. But given the price, I feel like im not really allowed to complain because it was expected. But still, it was horrid!"

Special thanks and apologies if I get spelling incorrect to Dee dee at the Concierge desk, and Moi-moi at the pool for their impeccable service.Below were the reasons I gave a 4 review1.  Bed set up wasn't ideal.  I have a family of 5 we rented a 2 bedroom and while residence was more than spacious, the 2nd bedroom was small and only contained a single bed so two of my teenagers had to share this bed, my third teenager had the pullout in the lounge, my husband and I the master.  The lounge was big enough to have another rollaway but there was too much furniture in the open plan space to put it had this been an option.2.  No bathroom door to close ensuite off from master bedroom.  When using the bathroom you felt you had little or no privacy.3.  No drying towel for dishes."

        "review_text": "Where do I begin? If it wasn't for the Luxury Escapes deal I wouldn't have chosen to stay here - and if there are Luxury Escapes deals in the future I wouldn't return for half the price.  The average facilities are blatantly obvious when you visit the neighbouring Hilton and Sheraton.  That's what a premium hotel is supposed to look and feel like. If it wasn't for the friendly staff such as Shelton at the front desk, I would rate this place a 1/5.  The location is good and can't be faulted but the biggest disappointment was the God awful food.  Leather like scrambled eggs and overcooked porridge (and that was in the Voyager club) was the norm.  The food in the restaurants isn't much better.  Overpriced and average.  I know we are spoiled for choice in Melbourne with great value for money and quality food, but this is supposed to be a premium hotel.  I would expect international F&B standards at worst.  Having stayed at other Outrigger properties this was clearly not up to standard. We had $500 of resort credits thrown in to use on F&B.  The fact that we had to spend almost $400 in souvenirs to use it up speaks volumes.  To be fair, it is Waikiki and in the heart of the tourist zone, and the food across town is expensive so I wasn't expecting a cheap meal - but I hate paying premium prices for awful food and average faciltites."

We originally booked one of the cheaper rooms they had for about 70 Euro a night (we only stayed one night) and we were upgraded on arrival to a two bedroom suite which had two bathrooms so I am not sure what the cheaper rooms are like. Here are a few pros and cons:Pros:Great location - close to transport system and mbk for shopping.Easy access to airport.Great for overnight stay if you are getting a flight the next day.Great Nightlife area across the street for a few beers.Staff are friendly.Big gym.Nice room - recommend the suites they are huge with a balcony.Great views of the city from the higher floors.Cons:Pool a bit boring nothing special at all.One lift was broken so we had to wait a bit.Rooms are a bit bland.Conclusion:All in all I think this is very good for the price even if you dont get upgraded - if you do, then all the better! Its not a hotel that will give you the lebua style treatment but it is better than any other in bangkok for the price range in my opinion. I would stay here again."

The pool area was lovely and swimming at night was also a nice little bonus.However... We were 'held hostage' by the hotel, on the night before we checked out we went down to the desk to see what time we had to check out and we were greeted by a rather rude man saying ok so that'll be 8000 aed, we had already paid for the whole holiday through a travel agent but the hotel refused to accept the fact that we had paid, they then said we had to stay in our room and not allowed to leave until it's sorted out, quite a scary experience really, it also ruined our last evening where we had booked an amazing restaurant in souk madinat, turns out the hotel had received the payments but they were refusing the payment as it was from a travel agent, would not recommended staying here."

The hotel is a 5-minute taxi ride from the cruise ship pier, it is a block and a half from the Light Rail (access to the airport) and two blocks from the Monorail access (Space Needle, Chihuly, Science and EMP Rock & Roll museums, etc.), as well as close to various bus routes.  Just about as good a location in downtown Seattle as you can get.The hotel itself is modern, well-maintained, clean and comfortable (great bed!), and the price was very reasonable by Downtown Seattle standards.  Service was friendly and professional.  The Asian restaurant off the lobby is reasonably priced and we enjoyed the food.  There are numerous eating establishments within just a short walk, priced from affordable to high end."

        "review_text": "I just returned from 5 nights staying at Outrigger Reef, and we really enjoyed our stay there.  I had been to Waikiki once before, and my partner had never been, so we wanted to be somewhere central where we were right on the beach, and this hotel suited all of our needs.The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the main foyer area is really well laid out, with plenty of shops, restaurants and great access to the pool and beach.Our room was on the 16th floor and had a partial view of the beach, which was great.  It was so nice to come back to a cool and comfortable room each day, and the fresh water bottles each day were appreciated.  The bathroom was lovely and the toiletries provided were above the usual standard.  The bed was comfortable, the wi-fi was excellent, and we had everything we needed.  I really prefer the hotel rooms where an empty fridge is provided, rather than the over priced mini bars, so we really appreciated being able to fill the small fridge with water and other drinks we had purchased.The hotel has absolutely everything you could need, and is in a great location. To be able to walk along the beach so easily, and be so accessible to shops and restaurants is great. Everything was spotless, and given the busy time and number of people staying there, it never felt overcrowded, which is good.The only thing we didn't really get full value out of (and have wondered if it would be better as an option rather than automatically added on) is the $30 per day resort fee.  The complimentary shuttle provided that goes to many great locations (and is just for Outrigger and Holiday Inn visitors) is such a great idea, as are the other bonuses/services of the resort fee, however on certain days we didn't use any of it (eg. the day we went to Pearl Harbour we were gone all day).  Perhaps if we had a family there would be more value.However, overall, our stay was wonderful and we are definitely inclined to use Outrigger more often in the future. A really great hotel."

The elevator in the parking garage across the street is inoperative and the word I was given, it may stay that way.

        "review_text": "The minute you step onto the grounds of the Halekulani and into its serenity you are taken far from the maddening crowds of hectic Waikiki. You have arrived in center of calm and peace in the middle of hustle and bustle of Kalakaua Avenue. Since I grew up on Oahu, I have watched the transition of this property grow from small green bungalows and gardens to high rises. On our many trips back we have always gone to the hotel's beachfront restaurant House Without a Key for drinks, dinner and hula but we have never stayed at the hotel. Prior to this trip we have usually stayed elsewhere primarily with family or The Royal Hawaiian's original pink lady building because of it Hawaiian tradition and the fact that I had birthday parties and took cotillion there.  But since we were celebrating my 50th high school reunion we decided to do something different this time. We stayed a few nights at the Hale Koa because that is where some school friends were staying and then we transferred to the Halekulani-very glad e did!. We arrived prior to check in time so we were invited to have a complimentary drink and wait by the pool. While we waited free cream popciles were distributed by the pool staff-something we later learned they do twice a day for pool guests. Within 30 mins we got a call that our room was ready.  Prior to going to our room a cheerful rep escorted us around the hotel who informed us of the different places to eat and shop, introduced us to the concierge and then took us to our room. My husband and I were on cloud nine the minute we walked into our direct ocean front view room-sheer beauty. Fresh papaya and chocolate were on the coffee. Our bags arrived within seconds. The closet between the bedroom and the bathroom had sliding doors that push back so we could enjoy the ocean view even while brushing out teeth! Our bed was extremely comfortable and we loved the abundance of pillows. Every night a printed thought for the day card and token were left on our bed. Once we walked out of our room and the minute we did a man vacuuming at the far end of the hall turn off the vacuum and waited until we got on the elevator to start up again-very thoughtful. We did not find our hotel room or other parts of the hotel in need of updating. We read on our room's balcony to enjoy the balmy ocean breeze. The floral arrangements throughout the complex are magnificent- assorted ginger and orchids. On Wednesday were invited to the manager's reception which was another 5 star touch.The Halekulani remains secluded because the hotel reps are constantly walking the property insuring its for quests only.  Also you will see several international couples getting married at the hotel. We think this is the place to splurge but the stay is priceelss and we will come back. We suggest you read the history of the hotel on their website and view the historical pictures before you go-it adds so much meaning to the experiencing of staying at the Halekulani."

        "review_text": "Hotel is 5 star. disappointed with the beds..not so comfy but gets of room is over the top. Not on the beach. You have to cross a small but busy street and walk down a public access to get to beach. Beach area is very thin and sloped that is allotted for Trump guests. You also must rent chairs and umbrellas. Ocean floor is covered with jagged rocks and not and enjoyable place to swim, I wish we had done our research better because there are nicer beach areas on Waikiki. I prefer to walk out of the hotel and have a nice place to enjoy the beach when I pay top dollar like this. The hotel does give you a pool bag with water and towels to take to the beach. Trump, you need to have the beach experience match the hotel\u2026Also pool is tiny but nice and staff is superb"

        "review_text": "We stayed here for 3 nights and we loved everything about it.  It's in a great neighbourhood with shops and restaurants literally at your door step.  The metro to DC sites is on the premises.  Parking is underground $27/night with in and out privileges.  The rooms were large and very comfortable.  The room was/felt new and fresh.  We had an accessible room and it very spacious especially the bathroom.  2 doubles and a pullout couch was ample for our family of 5.  kitchenette/bar area equipped with microwave, bar fridge, sink and coffee maker. It also had a great work area in the living room for business travellers.   The lobby is beautifully contemporary and check-in was a breeze.  The penthouse pool and gym are was well equipped and our children really enjoyed going for a swim after sightseeing in DC.  The made to order and buffet breakfast was great with lots of choices and happy hour was my favourite time of day. lol (complimentary beer, wine and snacks from 5-7).  We also took advantage of room service which was delicious and the portions were very large - also had a kids menu - we could have easily shares the salads - and reasonably priced.  This hotel is literally in a shopping centre with restaurants (cheesecake factory, starbucks etc) on site.  The adults loved it, the children loved it.  Would stay her again for sure."

        "review_text": "My review was honestly hovering between 3 and 4--and I settled on 4 mostly because the property is so physically spectacular.The building is impressive from the moment you approach.  It's 60 stories in a classic French style with dramatic gray stone facade, wrought iron balcony railings, mansard roof.  The courtyard you drive into is cobblestone-paved with a gorgeous central fountain and surrounding colonnades.  There are often Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside.The valets are always smiling and attentive--happy to open the door for you.The lobby is bright and striking.  You can see two stories up to an exquisite modern crystal chandelier.  They spared no expense on all the marble and tile mosaic-work in the interior.  There is interesting contemporary artwork throughout--including a sensational green painting behind the front desk.  I do wish they had kept out two arresting stone bust sculptures that had been in the lobby on previous visits.Unfortunately, there were some major issues with the service.  At a five diamond property, you expect a certain level of intuitiveness and communication among the staff.  Things should be seamless and you should feel as if service is going above and beyond.  Details are important if you want be considered one of the best.We were celebrating my 35th birthday and the concierge had been contacted to arrange a bottle of champagne to be waiting in the room upon arrival.  The concierge was contacted via email--responded by forwarding the in-room dining menu that only had three bottles of sparkling wine--just one of them actual champagne--no suggestions or recommendations.  After some back and forth, once a bottle was chosen, an auto-reply said that the concierge was no longer available and a general concierge email was CC'd.  We tried to confirm with an email to both concierge email addresses--but never heard from them again.  At check-in, we were asked if we were celebrating something special.  In my opinion, the concierge should have notated on our reservation that we were celebrating my 35th birthday .  The left arm definitely did not know what the right arm was doing.This is a no tipping hotel, which is nice.  But maybe that explains why nobody offered to help us with our bags to the room.Upon getting to the room--you guessed it, no champagne waiting for us.  It was supposed to be a nice surprise when I entered and a start to the celebration--and this really put a damper to the start of the trip.  After explaining what happened to the staff, they were very nice and said they'd immediately send up a bottle on the house.  This ended up taking almost an hour (how long does it take to put a bottle in a bucket and bring it up?!) and it was not the bottle requested--days in advance.  But at least they tried to make it right and you can't really complain about a free bottle of bubbly.We were called hours later by a manager saying they were ready to bring our bottle of champagne up--which made things even more comical.  Again, there was a total lack of communication and seamlessness.  And any semblance of keeping a surprise would have been ruined. I also have to say that, based on the issues we had, a top-notch hotel would have immediately had a manager reach out to apologize and handle the situation.More room service disappointment occurred when we ordered a bottle of Pellegrino water.  A room service attendant came up and brusquely handed over a plastic bottle of Pellegrino.  Call me nitpicky, but at a five diamond caliber hotel, I would hope for a nice glass bottle of Pellegrino served maybe on a platter with glasses and ice--perhaps some wedges of lime?  Instead--it was handed over to us like we were at a 7-eleven.The room itself was gorgeous.  It was very generously appointed.  We were upgraded to a larger room due to our Hilton Gold elite status which we greatly appreciated. We had a high floor with spacious balcony offering amazing views of city and peeks of the lake in the distance.  We had a stunning working marble fireplace.  I noticed many high end design details like elegant crown and base moulding, luxurious wetbar, crystal chandeliers, tasteful and comfortable furniture.  The bathroom was magnificent--again, they spared no expense--beautiful marble, tile mosaics, huge tub and shower.  They also have a fun feature where there is a TV that can play behind the bathroom mirror.  This feature was not working in our room, but we called and they quickly fixed it.  We were able to watch the Bears game while we brushed our teeth!  One unfortunate exception to the nice features in the suite is the bathroom phone was unceremoniously ripped out, but they left the empty bracket on the wall. It looked very unprofessional.There was additional frustration when we found out that the spa is under renovation and the lap pool and jacuzzis were closed. I specifically noted that, while booking, there was a disclaimer that said that only the women's whirlpool was closed. If I had known everything was closed, we probably would not have booked this hotel. The manager offered that though the lap pool and whirlpools were closed, they still had a \"wonderful eucalyptus steamroom\" available. Thanks?We did have one further issue when we called about a bath service.  At a fine hotel like this with one of the top rated spas in the country, I expect them to be happy to help draw a nice, romantic bath for you.  We called and asked if while we were out at dinner, they would be willing to have a romantic bath drawn and ready for us.  Two separate people seemed confused and said they needed to ask a supervisor.  We were finally called back and told they could do it for a $75 fee--but it would include romantic candles and nice bath treatments added.  We said fine.  Upon returning to the room, we saw one sad candle lit and a few pouches of packaged scrubs and salts.  No rose petals or anything like that to make it romantic.  Worst of all, they forgot to close the drain, so most of the water was already gone.  Very disappointing--especially for the price!  Maybe this was an appropriate final symbol of the lack of attention to detail.In addition to the superior premises, the other reason I ended up with a 4 star review is that the manager did try to make things right when he found out about some of our issues.  When he did get a hold of us and we explained our disappointments, he genuinely felt bad and apologized, and offered to remove some of the additional incidental charges from the bill.  This acknowledgement and very nice gesture went a long way.I should also point out that we dined several times at the main restaurant, Margeaux Brasserie.  I will give a full review separately, but I will say the restaurant is a gorgeous classic French brasserie and we enjoyed ourselves for dinner and brunch.  It was so nice to finally have a hotel that doesn't make you wake up at 9am to make breakfast on the weekends. Margeaux Brasserie served brunch (offering a variety of breakfast dishes) until 2pm on Saturday and Sunday.  In fact, Sunday offered a great live jazz band as well.  This helped make the trip much more relaxed and less rushed.  I did miss the old Bernard's bar, and am a little disappointed there really isn't a separate bar anymore. But again, they did do a really nice job with Margeaux!Hopefully this review is constructive.  In the end, it was frustrating that almost every attempt to make the weekend special and romantic was bungled.  But we still had a very nice time despite the snafus we experienced and we'd be happy to give the Waldorf another try."

Room wasn\u2019t ready at 10 am but he checked me into a room and took care of me when I came back.  I was on the 17thfloor in a roomy king suite w a lovely strip view and wonderful fireworks view. Quick elevators, attentive housekeeping, and clean as a whistle.  Not super soundproof so bring earplugs if that\u2019s an issue.  They had samples from their eateries in the lobby on arrival so that was fun.  We enjoyed the Juniper lounge (go during happy hour\u2014it\u2019s till 8) and a fun time at the bar watch8ng the cooks at lala noodle.  Although I love Lavazza coffee they had an awful ordering system and I never got any.  Didn\u2019t like the whole Eataly setup.Great hotel and a bonus free shuttle over to Aria and Bellagio."

        "review_text": "This is a boutique hotel located in an older building.  In fact it is two old buildings joined together.  if you are looking for a high end chain with cookie cutter rooms and full service this hotel is not for you.  if you like unique accommodations then read on.   This hotel is newly renovated and under new management.  It is a hip themed hotel with a inviting lobby with a bar and fireplace.  There is a relaxing space in the basement that has pool tables, shuffle board ,and 2 large screen TVs.  A millennial's dream.  We stayed in a room facing away from the street.  No view but very quiet.  The room has a lovely Boos work table and lots of plugs for your devices.  The bathroom is wonderful with a walk in shower.  A large smart TV is in the room along with a refrigerator.   Housekeeping is great.  The beds are comfortable.  There are bikes and scooters available for guests.  I highly recommend this hotel for the enlightened traveler who wants a hotel with personality."

        "review_text": "Overall, we had a really nice time. Our room was spacious and clean. Nice bed sheets. Friendly staff.The only issue is that restaurants, city shuttle and pool area are all so overcrowded. It felt as if the resort could barely cope with the number of people it was hosting. Even having made reservations every single time we went out for breakfast and dinner, we always had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table. Plumeria was particularly crowded for breakfast, with lines forming to reception and food areas inside being surrounded, which it didn't make a very relaxing experience. Same can be said for the pool area (the beach area less so, but it's still pretty small) - SO MANY PEOPLE for such a small pool and so few chairs! The resort could benefit from expanding on its pool and restaurant offerings to accommodate for its huge numbers of guests.TV in the room didn't have Netflix access which we came to expect in hotels nowadays.The spa for us was one highlight (we had a couple's romantic package which was a treat, albeit a pricey one, but so worth it. The ladies at the spa are AMAZING. This is in our top two couple's spa treatments ever, sharing the first spot with Polynesian Spa in Rotorua New Zealand!). Hoku was another highlight: chef's menu was spectacular. I would definitely recommend this resort."

The room as very nice but we discovered the remote barely worked and eventually died.  There was no movie ordering system, and only a sheet enumerating the channels, but no programming. The coffee maker had no instructions. The coffee packs were terrible, and there were few condiments. We dined at the MH restaurant (The Nob Hill Club) and my wife ordered Fettuccine that was tasteless and would not hold a fork up. I ordered Wild Sea Bass and found sever shards of white plastic in my fish. When we alerted the server and maitre d' they appeared concerned but she only comped my meal. Again, there was a pile of sharp plastic shards in my food!  I was a manager at Holiday Inn World Wide, and we would have comped the whole meal for such a disaster...  We went up to the Top of the Mark and the whole place looked a little rough. Dirty floors on Thursday evening, and the servers appeared disinterested and they took their time. We even had to get up and find ours once, and there were not many people up there that evening. The general areas of the hotel looked a little tired as well. Not least of all, they charged 5 Star prices for everything in exchange for 3 star products and services. Please understand that I love the Mark Hopkins and the other establishments on Nob Hill. They are part of my best memories, but the Mark Hopkins is fading, going rough around the edges, and the professionalism is sliding badly.  It's tragic for me to report this, but you have a right to know that they no longer deserve 4 stars."

        "review_text": "Having never visited San Francisco, I had no idea of the best areas to stay. My research told me being near Union Square would be a good choice and it has proved to be so. The Zeppelin is the icing on the cake in this district if you like something a bit different. There are several large, grandiose hotels in the area but the Zeppelin is what you'd call a boutique hotel. The decor is edgy and modern and the facilities are first class. The rooms are comfortable, the en-suites fresh, modern, with full baths and great showers with instant hot hot water. Great free wifi ( yes, really... many advertise this and the wifi is often slow and intermittent. Not here.) and a huge flat screen tv with internet capacity. Was happy to watch Wimbledon and baseball in our down times in the room. The reception staff are friendly and welcoming ( there was a small error in our booking and they handled it so easily without fuss). Can definitely recommend this hotel."

        "review_text": "We stayed here in March. It was pretty great! We had the one bedroom with the kitchen on the second floor overlooking the hot tub. It was a little dated, but clean. The beds were comfortable, AC worked great, the kitchen was nice and saved us a lot of money eating out. Had a full sized fridge too. The lanai was cool and very safe and our daughters (2 and 4) loved going out on there and watching the birds and the people below. Lots of tv channels and there was a PS3 as well as a dvd rental kiosk at the front desk.A couple of times the key system malfunctioned and we had to wait a few minutes before maintenance could open it or rekey it for us. Also, parking is very limited. We had a rental car and paid for a spot in their lot. It's not assigned parking and a few times the lot was full when we came back from doing something. The staff park there occasionally so you have to go ask them at the front desk and they will move for you. Other than that I can't say anything negative about them.The front desk staff is great, super friendly. I can't remember the woman's name but everytime you go buy she greets you with \"Hello Sunshine\" and would give our kids popsicles. She was great! The entire staff was. We extended our stay 3 days and they gave us the same rate we had booking a month earlier.The pool was clean and the hot tub was nice too. You wouldn't think you'd use one in Hawaii but it was still nice. The place has a more long term stay, family type feel than the bigger chain hotels on the beach, like Hilton or whatever. It was nice.A few blocks from the beach, half a block from the canal. Clean, affordable, family friendly, recommended!Side note-(One day tree trimmers came to work on the trees in the courtyard there. It was pretty neat to see them hand climb up the palm trees way up there to trim and prune. Our girls had a lot of fun watching them getting around up there! Some of those trees are scary tall.)"

        "review_text": "My wife and I go to Hawaii every couple of years.  I used to live in Honolulu so it is very familiar to me.  Of course living in a place offers a very different experience than being a tourist.  Yet in Hawaii it can be difficult to not cross paths quite often.The Kahala is truly a very special place, and not only because of its very special location.  It is situated in such a way that there are no other hotels anywhere around. The Kahala area of Honolulu has long been one of the most exclusive parts of Honolulu.  The hotel is directly on its own beach.  It is surrounded by the most impressive Waialae Country Club & Golf Course so all the surrounding area is really beautiful.  If you don't happen to get an ocean view the golf course and mountains are are a nice vista as well.From the many times we have stayed there I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience.  But then I tend to be kind and empathetic when requesting service.Another exclusive to my knowledge that the resort offers is the resident dolphins.  They have several in their lagoon and you and get in the water and have your picture taken with them.  This is a really big hit with the kids believe me.  It is always busy.This property is not new, but it is maintained in pristine condition, and I tend to be on the picky side.  I even walk around outside the perimeter of the hotel where guests don't venture and just look to see how those places are kept.  Even the service dock is clean and organized.If you don't want a rental car they offer a very convenient shuttle service to the local shopping mall and the tourist ghetto of Waikiki, if you wish to go.  The mall is highly recommended, and I think you know my opinion of Waikiki.In summary this is the place for you if you have the means.  I might mention that many famous celebrities choose to stay here, and we have seen several in previous trips.  One wall in the shopping arcade has many of their pictures taken while staying here.  From Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra to more recent musicians, movie stars, and politicians including former US Presidents."

They made me feel right at home during my stay and where extremely helpful.The atmosphere is beautiful and you can see the attention to detail throughout the hotel. Design and quality shines through.The rooms are cozy and make you feel like you\u2019re not in NYC anymore. We did not hear any street noise which was perfect after a busy day. The beds are one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on.The amenities offered are top notch, again you can see the attention to detail. Comfortable robe, slippers, and extremely soft towels.If you\u2019re looking for a new hotel experience, this is it. I was very pleased with my stay and had a great experience. Although short and sweet this time, I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future when the roof top bar is open!"

As part of a business group the rates were quite reasonable.While the lobby is modern, the hallways feel a bit worn.  The room itself was quite nice however - a corner room with very nice views of the city and Bay Bridge.  As a Hilton HHonors member you can buypass the checkin desk with the Hilton app to select your room and use your phone as your room key.While I'd probably stay elsewhere in SF with my spouse or immediate family, it's a great hotel for business."

Price payd was higher than the official one for a superior room but at the reception they said the reservation was for a basic room and no chance to have better one. However the real bad news was whan I entered the room and I found a wall just in front of the window and the wc dirty because  already  used !!! The receptionists said that they could not do anything beacuse the hotel was fully booked and norevoer there were work in progress in some floors ! I sent a complaint in real time to the customer service and the answer was that unforunately the Comfort inn hotels are privately owned and out of the control of the central customer care !  I strongly suggest to avoid this hotel !!!"

The decor is pleasing to the eye and it thinly veils the filth underneath, best described as an elaborate illusion.The bed in my room would not even be acceptable in a flop house.  One side of it is significantly lower than the other, probably a hangover from some obese guest that I can't stop imagining.  You hear and feel springs pop and recoil when you sit down.  I cannot imagine how I am going to get thru this stay.  Barely slept a wink last night in this misery.After not sleeping due to incredibly awful bed, I decided to start my day early in the \"fitness center\", a small, windowless closet on the 6th floor, so smelly and dirty it is impossible to describe adequately.  There were exactly two machines in their \"fitness center\", one elliptical and one treadmill.  Both were loosely strewn amongst the garbage and filth.  And stink.  I worried about contracting a disease in there.  There was no way to work out, so dejected I went back to my room....This place is the worst!  Avoid at all costs."

We get there, we were set to do our bar crawl had some minor issues there. I called down to the lobby for THREE days stating our shower had no hot water. The engineer never came. We checked out and I happened to check my bank account. They CHARGED ME ANOTHER $175 in Error. I went back to find out what happened and they just told me it was a mistake and that they would refund in 3 to 5 business days. They over drafted my account and all they had to say was sorry.

I stayed at the Four Queens with my travel companion (a regular there) with no great expectations, but we had a really good time. The staff was fantastic and very helpful. The only downside was the hotel is under a major remodeling, which meant no ice machine on any of the floors. No big deal, since room service was quick to deliver a bucket of ice. Downtown is much more laid-back and slower-paced. And if you join the Player's Club you can earn valuable points toward a reduced room rate, prizes and a break on your restaurant bill. While some prefer the strip's faster pace, many of us old-timers prefer downtown ."

Room was dark and small, and we were unable to open the blinds as we heavily overlooked by the neighboring hotel wing.There were no net curtains.Staff were polite but were not really welcoming. The pool is extremely small for the size of the hotel. We only recall one night out of seven when we were there when the hotel had any entertainment..I would not describe this hotel as value for money. The only plus side was it's location as it is central to the main shopping area.We had an unfortunate mix up on the day of our departure when i released due the time difference we had to vacate our room in a hurry. We checked out few hours late. We had to catch a flight so i asked front of desk to charge my credit card to clear my account and email me the receipt. When i returned home still the receipt was not emailed as promised and had to make a couple of calls before the finally emailed the receipt. When i saw the receipt i was shocked to see the hotel added $300 dollars for vacating just a few hours late. the front desk hadn't reminded us either so it was obvious the room had not been taken by anyone else. Our room was booked through Expedia, who also agreed that the amount charged for the over stay seemed excessive. They spoke on my behalf to the hotel but they didn't want to know and the charged had to be paid. We had spent over $2000 dollars in a week with excursions and food at the hotel but seems like this was not enough for the hotel to take into consideration  miss-hap with our timing. it's safe to assume we will not be returning or recommending the Moana surfrider."

Over $10 a night, It's 2015!If wifi is complimentary in wooden cabins on thai islands how can it be so expensive in one of Americas major cities. It really gives the impression they are just trying to get as much money out of you as possible. Really disappointing in an otherwise very good hotel."

        "review_text": "This is our 2nd visit to his hotel and once again we were not disappointed, it's ABSOLUTELY incredible. We had a package which included breakfast at the Wicked Spoon, breakfast can be taken between 8am and 5pm, on one of our days we choose to eat around 4, the only difference eating later was there were not eggs and bacon, but other than that the choices were endless. So the breakfast choices of food went from eggs, bacon, fruit and your cereals to rib eye steak, gammon, oysters, pizza, pasta and even chinese. The dessert counter was incredible including the ice creams. The service was always good and there was never a shortage of food. The room we choose this time was a one bedroom terrace, it was clean, spacious, including a lounge area, a dressing area, a large bathroom including a shower and Japanese soaking tub. The room had sliding doors which opened up onto a terrace which was lovely, we used to sit out there of an evening when we got back from the strip and first thing in the morning, we looked out onto the fountains and it's a view I will never tire. The hotel is central, modern and very quirky, I love all the different themed areas, there is so much attention to detail which I sure most people don't even noticed, I found something new to look at everyday. I truly love all the art work in this hotel and for the first time we seeked out the hidden places, including the bar and restaurant behind the Essex & Beauty pawn shop, the late night pizza kitchen and my favourite which was The Ghost Donkey tequila bar, which again was hidden behind a fire exit door and opened up into something magical. Would I stay here again, absolutely as I just love it."

        "review_text": "We stayed 5 nights with our 18&19 year old boys in a Bora Bora suite.  It was the perfect size for us.   We had a rollaway brought in and one of the boys used the fold out couch.  Both were very comfortable.  The room was a great size for us although it did take a bit to get used to sharing one bathroom.  Having said that, it was a very large bathroom so that was great.   We arrived at noon and were lucky enough to get our room right away.  It was a fabulous room in building one, top floor corner overlooking the pool.  I had requested a higher floor, pool view at time of booking so was very pleased they were able to accommodate that.  It was a smoking room and we had asked for a non-smoking but since there were no non-smoking available until closer to 4 we decided to take this one.  So glad we did.  We all agreed that we barely noticed any smell.   Loved sitting on the balcony in the morning and evening overlooking the pool.   We ate at the Denny\u2019s after we checked since we were all really hungry.   Long wait and not great food.  We all wished we had walked a block down and gone to Outback.   We used Lyft and went to Smith\u2019s to stock up on groceries, wine etc.  It was great having a full kitchen.  We ate breakfast and lunch every day in our room and then usually had dinner on the Strip.   We did use the shuttles a couple of times but we preferred using Lyft to get to where we wanted to be on the strip verses having to choose between Tropicana or Mirage.  We had some promo codes that with $5 off we usually ended up paying $4-6 to get to wherever we needed and we never waited more than 5 minutes and we didn\u2019t have to deal with crowds waiting for the shuttle.This hotel was a great fit for us and we loved our room.  Having said that, there were some room locations that I think we would have been very unhappy in so I can understand some of the negative reviews that I read.  We also didn\u2019t use the shuttle much so that was a non-issue for us as well.  We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  We booked through Expedia and I got a much better price than I was able to get booking the flight and hotel on my own.   We were never once approached by the time share sales people."

The hotel is located in a great spot,  road, less than a 5 minute walk to South Beach and there plenty of places to eat nearby. Our room was a decent size and had recently been renovated. Nice bathroom but tiny sink and no room out your bathroom amenities anywhere. Foyer and entry entry looked quite new as well. Hotel is only 3 stories and has a lift. Free wifi worked well. Always saw a couple of staff at reception who were quite helpful. The hotel does not have parking but offers a $30 valet service. We pulled up out front, dropped our bags, and parked a couple of blocks away in a parking station for $20 for 24hours. The pool area was also new but not very big i.e. more than 5 people in it and it feels crowded. I was a little concerned about noise as hotel was on a main road but we all slept well. Our room was the first one closes to reception so we did get a bit of foot traffic. Overall good value and great location considering how expensive many Miami hotels are."

I had a few annoying logistical issues to sort (nothing to do with them) but I needed their help. Totally aced it.Good location. Close enough but not totally central so you can go off the beaten track a bit and I guess that's why it's cheaper than the big-name-big-price hotels. If you're travelling on your own dime but also don't want to rough it, this will suit."

I arrived hours before check in time and the lady at the front desk had no problem upgrading and getting us to our room. The Fremont Street experience was a sight to see along with the assorted characters as well. If someone is thinking of staying downtown, I would definitely recommend the 4 Queens."

        "review_text": "The Modern, well what can I say.... From the moment we arrived it was an effort... check in was awful didn\u2019t tell us anything about the hotel facilities etc, then we walked to towards the lift to go to our room only to be pounced on by what we thought was the concierge only to find it was time share people... not what you need when you\u2019ve just arrived from a long flight. Next our room I can\u2019t faulty that it was nice and modern. We thought we\u2019d go for a swim and relax only to be told it was off limits due to a wedding party, so then we thought we\u2019d go to the bar oh hang on that was off limits as well, due to a private party!!  We were advised by the reception that we could order a drink to take in our room mmmmm... So rather than take this option we went to the hotel next door for drinks and food when we returned to our room we\u2019re blasted by 80\u2019s classic from the private party going on downstairs. Next morning we went to breakfast only to find it was off limits due to another private party but we could have breakfast in the foyer bar.  We then enquired at reception what events were on during the week so we knew what days we could use the hotel facilities bear in mind we were paying resort fees... but not receiving any resort benefits... We were advised most days of our stays the facilities were out of bounds due to private functions.... Seriously!! At this point we asked to see the manager but they refused to make an appearance so the poor chap on the front desk had to keep relaying messages backwards and forwards, we made the decisions to contact our travel agent in the uk advised them of the issue, and they immediately got us a full refund and offered us several other hotels to choose from we opted to hire a car and go to The Kahala Hotel & Resort best decision we made. We would not recommend The Modern, brochure images look great but zero service, general attitude and lack of facilities that you are allowed to use, it\u2019s a function and time share pushing hotel that\u2019s it!"

        "review_text": "My most recent stay at Hotel Renew was my fifth or sixth time staying here as a \"Staycation\". I live on Oahu and after my first time staying at Hotel Renew about seven years ago, I've used it as my go to spot when I get the urge to spend a weekend in Waikiki. I noticed a downturn in quality after my last stay which was in August 2017. Not enough to prevent me from returning but after my most recent stay, I will not ever book at the hotel again. It started with a relatively cold reception upon check in. I was looking forward to the cold towel upon check in but it was not offered on this stay. The receptionist was just short tempered and not friendly. Upon entering the room, there was an odd smell. Not enough to request a new room but enough to notice as slightly offensive. The bathroom was not cleaned well as it looked like \"water\" marks around the toilet. The shower doors were both jammed or off track and would not close as hard as I tried so we had to shower with the door open. Even after all of this, I would have given the hotel a 3 star rating but what happened next made me decide I would never stay here again. About 20 minutes before I departed the room, I was using the sink in the bathroom when I noticed a fast and heavy dripping from the ventilation duct above the sink. It increased in pace to a slight steady flow. It soaked my toiletry kit with all of my items inside. When I went to remove it, I noticed an odor, and I smelled the water and it had the odor of sewage. I quickly placed my toiletry kit in a plastic bad and ended up throwing several items away and washed the bag itself. If I wasn't so close to checking out, I would have immediately called the front desk. I washed my hands and left the room to check out. It was the same receptionist who provided the cold reception the day prior. She began to go over the room charges and I interrupted her to tell her about the foul smelling water leaking in the bathroom. She responded with \"OK, I'll call maintenance and get someone to check on it\". No apology, no offer to comp something like parking. Thanks for fixing that on my way out. I promptly left the hotel and do not plan on returning. Room 602."

        "review_text": "While I knew that Loews was a decent 5-star hotel, I didn't expect the level of effort the staff put into their service. I was given a free upgrade without hassle (Expedia Gold) and was given a very thorough explanation of the hotel and room. The views were amazing and the housekeeping was just as amazing. The free house car (an S-Class) took us to our dinner reservation and picked us up afterwards. In short, the service made up for the few shortcomings (that were really only temporary such as a telephone/internet outage late at night, and the fact that both the spa and the restaurant were under renovation but we were not informed prior to check-in). Will definitely consider staying again on next trip."

        "review_text": "As a loyal spg I went with this property for a short stay in Oahu but never again..Its a massive resort caos with no pool and practically no beach.. Stay away it is so not worth the price!  I did the mistake of reading these recent bad reviews and still giving it a shot for its location and price.You might think its a good deal for a Westin but is not because its more of a Sheraton or lower quality/service.Pros- Location location location- Friendly staff- Spg Platinum Beach club access- Parking is free for spg gold & platniumCons- Rooms are small and not clean. Bathroom was super small it reminded of the NYC hotels- Killed TWO COCKROACH in the room and had the staff come up and spray the room yet again on our last day we found another one walking in the bathroom floor. - Was not offered a room change in the newer section even though I asked.- Still unsure what was the $30+ nightly resort fee was for since there wasn't much we benefited other than the 2 free bottles of water everyday.- Pool is super small for a 'resort' you probably cant fit more than 20 ppl comfortably in that pod.-  Hotel lobby is a caos every hour of the day multiple wedding photo shoots, tourist groups,lots of kids- Understaffed for all services. One example:Asked for bathroom slippers before shower, it took them 45mins+ to deliver.- Beach is close to not existent yes you are in the famous waikiki beach but any other public beach is even better than the section in front of the property. Beach chairs are all by the pool and you have to purchase them every day which is very odd to me that hotel guests have to purchase seats to chill ( would have been nice if the resort fee at least covered this)- If you are in the main building room is pretty outdated and old.Thankfully we were exploring the island most of the time and didn't have to spend too much time in the room. We will be back in Oahu but probably will never be back to this westin.I recommend you read these reviews and save yourself some frustration in beautiful hawaii islands."

The panorama view from the room looked up and down Waikiki Beach with a breathtaking vista of Diamond Head.The service at the Moana Surfrider was top notch.  Everyone was extremely kind and always helpful.  I worked with the concierges to book outings and dinner reservations.   They were always in tuned to what my needs were.  They would go out of their way to accommodate and make sure I had a positive experience.You can tell they hotel is well managed by the loyalty and happiness of the staff.  I met two bartenders that have worked at the hotel for over 30 years.  Both were masters of their trade and always friendly.Book your room today!  You will be guaranteed a wonderful experience and stay at the Moana Surfrider.  I will continue to refer friends and family to stay at the hotel."

Very pleased to have a lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom. Decent view (on 7th floor in 704). I liked the animal print robes. Wifi was super and they don't log you out each day and make you enter the password again. Concierge had restaurant suggestions printed and waiting for me in the room when I arrived...along with a coconut water! I ate at all of those restaurants and they were fantastic across the board.Bath products smell divine - I could not get enough of that Bigelow body lotion.Most quiet room that I have ever had in SF! It was practically soundproof in my particular room.Kimpton really made a strong impression on me. LOVE the Kimpton Karma rewards program - the perks are superb. Would absolutely suggest this elegantly playful hotel to anyone who doesn't mind the lack of hotel facilities during renovations (e.g. no in-house restaurant or room service, no bar, no spa). I didn't need any of those due to the hotel's stellar location. Would absolutely stay here again!"

The room design is very consideration, with all the control of lighting, curtain, air-conditioning in single touch panel. So you do not need keep pacing inside the room busy adjusting the switches.Love the electronic controlled curtain , have \u201cblind\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d mode so that you can enjoy enough sunlight and city in the room without wasting the panorama view given.The bathroom is separated into wet and dry section with city view too, the toilet is located separately from shower.The entire stay is perfect. And privacy is main concern for the hotel, hotel lobby located in 24th floor , with quiet atmosphere although the hotel located just beside bts station and busy business district.I do not have much time to enjoy the hotel facility, eg the infinity pool, Michelin star restaurant, sky bar..but I will definitely back with more luxury time for all these !"

        "review_text": "We went this \"landmark\" hotel for a 2 night visit when we were in San Francisco and the only thing that we can say was what a sad hotel stay we had.We requested a high floor when our reservation was made, upon check in we were given a room on the 5th floor, not quite what we requested, so we went back down and tried again, this time we were given an upgraded room on the 11th floor right next to the elevators (room 1119). Over an hour later our bags had still not been brought to our room so back down we went again and there our bags sat on bellman's trolley as two bellman were just talking to each other....The \"upgraded\" room had broken air conditioning which was brought to the attention of the manager on duty who profoundly apologized. The good news was when we got back to our room at the end of the day he did send up some snacks to help ease the pain, sadly the air conditioning was still broken.The final straw to this really mediocre hotel experience was when we went down for a morning coffee reasonably priced at only $6 a cup and was poured half of a 6 once cup and offered a moldy biscotti.Overall a shameful display of an IHG property. I am an IHG spire elite member and would never stay here again."

It's just SO luxurious and private. Even the rooms seem to have some muffled soundproofing. It's like your own little cocoon. I could die happily in the beds...or at least sleep all day! Check in...disappear (unless you want something and then it's at your fingertips)...and emerge a happier person. The bar ambiance is Hemingwayesque. The scotches!

They also have a day room if needed for early checkout which has a couple of computers and a printer and a laundry room with a couple of washing machines and dryers.When we checked into our room the toilet was broken and they didnt hesitate in upgrading us from the 7th to the 12th floor. My sister and her daughter arrived the next day and they were upgraded too to be on the same floor as us. Anytime I have rung reception I have been greeted with a friendly response. The canal, mountain and diamond views are exceptional, you do hear the odd firetruck go by, but it is on the main road and noise is not a big problem, though I would probably always try for the highest floor you can afford.The wifi was good. There is a coffee maker with coffee and tea bags in the room, plus a small fridge. There is plenty of storage and a safe. Breakfast is basic but plentiful and nice and I don't eat a big breakfast anyway. I think they have the best pool in Waikiki, We had several lunches and many happy hour cocktails around the pool. It is a short 10 minute shopping walk to the beach. The trolley bus and public buses are only on the next street up and there is also a ABC store on the corner for all your needs and a food pantry a short walk down from that. There are quiet a few decent restaurants close by too. You also get a 10% discount voucher for your return visit. I absolutely adore Waikiki Sand Villa and shouldn't recommend it so highly as It may make it hard to book in in the future, so to the management please remember me if i have a hard time booking in in the future."

        "review_text": "Easily the worst experience I have ever had with any hotel (from 1 star to 5), in over twenty years of travel.I was booked in with my family (wife plus 2 children) for 1 night.  When we arrived, our room had ONE bed.  I had specifically noted on the reservation that we were 2 adults + 2 children and that we would need a 2nd bed or a sofa / rollaway bed).  I rang down to front desk and was told \"oh, we can send up some extra blankets for you.\"  How are extra blankets supposed to help when four of us are expected to sleep in one bed?  To my amazement,  the hotel was not able to secure us a rollaway bed.  They told me I would be \"put on a waiting list\" for one.  What???  I also found the attitude of the front desk person to be condescending and totally unhelpful.  There was no apology, no attempt to make the situation right.It is incredible to me that a four star hotel could be so completely incompetent.  We ended up checking out straight away and canceling our weekend in the city.  This was not a cheap booking - the idea of spending so much money only to have four people share a bed or have someone sleep ON THE FLOOR is ridiculous.  I would never stay in a Hyatt hotel again.From the little I seen of the room - I would say that they are very dark and rather dated, though the balconies are nice and some certainly have good views of the waterfront."

        "review_text": "This review is conditional, as I will explain -- at length.I have stayed at the Clift many times going back more than 10 years, always choosing their best suites, whenever I am in SF. My stays have always been outstanding, including this past summer when my fiance and I again stayed in the top suite and loved it.So imagine my surprise when I booked a weekend for my partner and her daughter to celebrate her daughter's 21st birthday, only to have the front desk refuse to check them in under my AmEx (Platinum) card which I had provided weeks before when I made the reservation. A girl at the front desk said the card \"had to be present physically in order to be used,\" and since I wasn't there with my card, they would not accept it.My partner called me as her daughter stood by in the lobby wondering if this was the celebration I had promised them. The girl at the desk was rude and dismissive over the phone, so I demanded to speak with the manager. Another woman named \"Fawn\" (she refused to give me her full name...) came on the phone, and I explained the situation to her as calmly as i could, including the fact that I've stayed at The Clift MANY times, and that I had pre-arranged this weekend using my same (Platinum) card that I've used every time I have stayed at the hotel.Fawn's response was, \"Unfortunately that means nothing in this situation. A Credit Card has to be arranged in writing 48 hours ahead, so we cannot accommodate you.\"  I asked why no one else had told me this (I had just spoken to the Concierge the day before to arrange a bottle of champagne to be left in the room...), and Fawn said, matter of factly, that was \"impossible.\"I told her I had stayed in this very suite just in June, and could she please look and see that the same AmEx card had been used then. She flat out refused to even look, and now she was not only rude, she was belligerent.So... my choice was to tell my partner and her daughter to go searching out another hotel on a Friday afternoon in San Francisco or to accommodate \"Fawn\" and have my partner put the room on her Visa card. We agreed on the latter even though that made me cringe. I told Fawn she had not heard the last of this, and her response was simply, \"Fine.\" I asked for her full name again, and she refused to give it to me. The Manager of a Five-Star hotel refuses to give a long time guest her name...? Seriously...!?I wasn't finished. I called Expedia and the folks there were as kind and helpful as always in finding that the suite I wanted at The Clift was available, and they promptly took my AmEx card over the phone, booked and paid for the room, and arranged for my partner and her daughter to be escorted up to the suite immediately.\"Fawn\" and her desk clerk were not pleased, and gave my partner the cold shoulder as the bellman took them up to the suite.So... all's well that ends well, right? Not quite. After enjoying the weekend I had wanted them to enjoy in spite of being treated rudely and horribly by these incompetent staffers, my partner arrived home after a smooth flight only to find that \"Fawn\" and her \"Staff\" had put through multiple charges on our credit cards -- despite my paying through Expedia, yes, they put through a $1,000.00+ charge on my partner's Visa card on top of the $1,000.00 one on my AmEx card, and in addition, they added a $350 \"cancellation fee\" on my partner's Visa card!!Needless to say, we were, and are, angry customers. As I write this, I have enlisted help from Expedia to get my partner's charge \"released.\" (It was on a debit card, and the withdrawal showed already at her local bank...)  I will report back if and when this charge has been taken back, but so far it has not.Since I see that you read these reviews, Michael Pace, hopefully you will respond as someone even minimally skilled in hospitality to not only make this situation right, but to also let me know that your rude, belligerent, incompetent employees at the front desk have been reminded that their duties are to welcome and accommodate guests -- especially loyal, returning guests seeking only to repeat fine experiences they have had at your hotel in the past. I can call just about any business on the planet and give my credit card over the phone or the internet to them. So... earth to The Clift... what planet do you think you are on?"

        "review_text": "Acclaimed historic hotel on Waikiki beach, I can honestly say that, while beautiful, the \"resort\" is lacking in class in both rooms and customer service. My husband and I, both well-traveled, are currently staying for 3 nights at the Moana Surfrider in a \"City View King\" after staying at the Turtle Bay Resort on the North Shore in an ocean view premier King for 5 nights. We were hoping to book an ocean front room here as well; however, none were available at the time of our booking months ago due to the busy holiday travel. We thought \"oh, it'll be fine, we will just be in the room to sleep anyway.\" Boy, were we mistaken in our judgment. We happily checked into the hotel and made our way to our \"historic\" room in the main part of the hotel. After stepping out of the elevator, we found that our room was directly next to the elevator door. Uh oh. That's never a good sign for what's to come - noise level will be high and the rooms closest to the elevator bank are usually smaller. What we found was a room that was no bigger than our walk in closet at home, a typical and expected city view, and a bathroom that was so small it didn't have any countertops! We had to leave our toiletries, hairbrush, etc sitting on the top of the toilet!!! SERIOUSLY?! How's a girl supposed to get ready for dinner when she has no place to set her hair tools? Additionally, we could hardly walk around the room with our two pieces of luggage taking up the 5 square feet of room space that was actually available and not taken up by furniture in the glorified closet-room. Did I mention that the room also SMELLS?!? It reeks of mothballs, dust, and other odorous atrocities. Obviously, I wanted to do whatever I could to get us out of this \"room\". I called the front desk and pleaded for any other room, and said we are more than happy to pay for something nicer, to which I heard the generic \"we are full, please try again tomorrow\". REALLY? I walked to the front desk to see if I could get more accomplished in person. I let the attendant know that we are SPG Gold members (and that our family with the same last name are taking up two ocean front rooms in the hotel as well); she typed a few things in on her computer and left to go chat with a supervisor. She came back 5 minutes later with a \"no, sorry, we are totally full; please come back tomorrow at 8 AM.\" SERIOUSLY? It's obvious you have something available for me, otherwise you wouldn't have anything to ask your supervisor about!!! LIES from a front desk attendant working on 12/29 at 7:15 PM - can't remember her name. Additionally, I know that hotels have a 10% attrition rate and that they are never fully sold out - on top of that, I did a Kayak search to find an available room and there were TWO different rooms available!!!! Room 1: city view Room 2: ocean view. COME ON MOANA SURFRIDER RECEPTION, do you think I'm not smart enough to figure this out??? I am going down again at 8 AM tomorrow to try to get a better room - review update to come (hopefully); otherwise, this will be the last time we offer our business to this establishment (and possibly to SPG in general - and to think of the wonderful way we were treated at Turtle Bay - we should have just stayed there)."

        "review_text": "I read others' positive reviews of this hotel and all I can say is, I wholeheartedly concur! We just visited for one night (to celebrate our wedding anniversary), but everything was lovely. When they learned it was our anniversary, they upgraded our room (41st floor with a gorgeous view of the Bay Bridge) and even sent up a split of champagne and some chocolate-covered strawberries with a handwritten note. Talk about a nice surprise!   We also ate in the lobby restaurant and the food was terrific. Ahi poke was fresh, the rack of lamb perfectly cooked and spiced, and the steak was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I wasn't thrilled about the neighborhood when we made our reservation, but we had a lovely stroll on the Embarcadero; it was almost like we were tourists!"

It does look old. The doors of the rooms dont look so nice. The bed was comfortable and it was clean. We had chosen this hotel because it had no resort fee. There is no free wi-fi in the hotel but as soon as you go on Fremont St you can get free wi-fi so there is no need to pay $8.99 per day for the internet. Parking was $3.00 per day which was ok although the other hotels (the Fremont, which is right next door) is free. The staff was ok. There is a pool in the sister hotel which can be used."

        "review_text": "Went to Vegas to the Aerosmith concert and this hotel was connected to the Park Theater.  The hotel rooms were comfortable, clean and had great views. Not a luxury room but it serves the purpose  for the time you spend in the room. Stayed on the 26th floor with a strip view.  The beds and pillows are super comfortable, baths looks redone.The only downfall was I could hear the neighbors through the wall.  It could be that they were just extra loud - One playing loud rap music but he stopped around 8pm.  The other neighbor was just a loud woman who didn\u2019t stop talking all night.  Think she eventually went out but insisted on banging her door when she went in and out several times. But I guess that comes with all hotels.The casino had the typical Vegas gaming.  Didn\u2019t see too many people winning.  I lost it all there.  More crowded at night.  3 pools and luckily one was adults only which is where we went.Staff was friendly and helpful.  Everyone complains about the check in / check out kiosks.  I didn\u2019t have trouble at all.  We had 2 rooms.  One was available when we arrived at noon.  The other was ready at 3pm.The hotel is pretty central to the south part of the strip: MGM, New York, New York, Paris and Planet Hollywood.  Next to the T-Mobile arena and Park Theater ... all within walking distance.Will definitely stay there again if the deals are good."

This was the first time my husband and i took a Vacations Hawaii Charter tour to Las Vegas, which included a stay at the California Hotel. Our room which was basic was spacious, clean, and our king-size bed was so comfortable. The hotel restaurant had very reasonable prices (meals were included in our package tour) and served pretty good comfort food items with large servings that were delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful.  We would definitely stay here again. We are planning to return to this hotel again next year."

The room was large and clean.  We didn't use the kitchen but it was like an apartment.  There is construction going on in the area so you may need to do a lap around to figure out the parking garage.  There are 2 hotels so just be patient.  You also need to go inside the front desk and get a parking pass that opens the garage door.  A slight pain, but again no biggy once you figure it out.  It's a block from the water front and an easy walk to all the hot spots in G-Town."

        "review_text": "I guess it\u2019s not so secret how very well situated this hotel is in Waikiki. It\u2019s on the southern edge of the main drag. Half of the rooms gets just a strip of the view of the ocean front for a bargain price and the other half is significantly more expensive but with spectacular views of the ocean and Diamond Head. Everything on Waikiki Beach is just a few minutes walk away. The zoo is practically next door to this hotel and there\u2019s a huge park where you can exercise or jog. You can rent bicycles on the street. There was an exercise schedule with one hour of you got included for hotel guests. We were not this hard core so we didn\u2019t take it vantage of this. The classes, four out of five times of the week Monday through Friday, started at 8 AM. On Thursdays class started in the afternoon. There were no classes offered during the weekend.Breakfast, lunch and dinner places are abound in Waikiki.There is a Japanese restaurant in the hotel, which is very famous for its authentic Japanese breakfast for a reasonable price; the club on the second floor serves breakfast with the view; there are two ABC stores flanking the hotel; there\u2019s a health food place on the ground floor as well And the Starbucks is just on the other side of the health food place, about 15 yards away.The towel and small beach rentals are included in your room price.The rooms are a decent size, very clean and fairly modern. The air condition works beautifully. Since the hotel doesn\u2019t have a kitchen, no room service can be had.The only complaint I have is that the hotel coffee maker is wreaking of plastic smell and taste so even the hot water that I ran through it was horribly plasticky. Very cheap coffee machines.We absolutely love the location. I would definitely stay here again."

Upon checking in at 11pm, the clerk, Joaquin, presented us with 2 bottles of water and a snack, which was welcome because it was late and were a bit hungry and thirsty from our long flight.  He upgraded us to the 10th floor with a nice city view.  The hotel is in a fantastic location and near everything.  The doormen/concierge staff, Solomon, Corric, and Elmer, always greeted us with a smile and obtained a taxi for us quickly.  They also arranged for us to be picked up by the City Sights tour bus in front of our hotel.  It was quite hot and humid in DC and the pick-up was appreciated.  They are the best doormen/concierge staff I have ever encountered!  The hotel has a laundry room on the 2nd floor with 2 washing machines and 2 dryers.  The cost is $1.50 each and there is a small machine that contains laundry detergent and fabric softener sheets.  The hotel also has a small fitness center on the 2nd floor that features 2 treadmills, a stationery bike and an elliptical machine.  There are also free weights and medicine balls.  The hotel bakes homemade Otis Spunkmeyer cookies on Sunday-Thursday around 6pm and they are displayed at the front desk.  Don't miss these cookies!  They are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted and they are gone fast!!  One night, Joaquin even called our room to let us know the cookies had just been put out at the front desk.  How considerate!  The hotel features a hot breakfast each morning until 10am.  I've suggested to management that they extend the breakfast to 11am, especially on weekends, because it can be quite crowded.  They rotate the egg selection daily.  They also have a homemade waffle station with 2-3 waffle makers.  Their waffle batter makes delicious waffles.  They have an assortment of yogurts, fruit, pastries, oatmeal, cereals, and juices.  Fresh, hot coffee is available 24 hours per day, along with a bowl of apples or oranges.  Plenty of variety to please any palette.  One of the breakfast staff, Mayra, always greeted me with a smile each morning.  Our room safe was not working on the 1st day and their maintenance man, Aaron, came to our room with 2 bottles of water, apologized for the inconvenience and promptly repaired the safe.  Outstanding service!  The managers of this hotel, Joseph and John, were also very caring and really listen to their customers.  I would not hesitate to stay here again and refer all my friends and family to this wonderful hotel."

We wanted a central place where we could walk out and have everything close by and that is what we got. Yes it is old and tired but our room was clean, bed comfy and everything worked. We were up on the 11th floor which I expect is one of the quieter floors so nothing to complain here. Every member of staff were friendly and helpful. So my advice is to really know exactly what you want from a hotel in Washington and choose this with your eyes wide open. I would use it again."

It didn't exactly feel as luxurious as advertised but it was definitely nice. However, I booked the hotel through a 3rd party and prepaid for the room. Upon check-in I was asked for a credit card and I was hesitant and I explained I already paid and feared being charged twice. The receptionist checked and saw I had paid, but needed the card for incidentals, fair enough. Well before I check- out I happened to check my credit card statement and sure enough I was charged again for the hotel room, this time more than what I even paid for the original room. I explained this at the check out desk, where they first denied doing it and then when someone else came over, apologized and took the charge off my card, and it reflected on my credit card balance immediately. Unfortunately this wasn't the end, a few days later I checked my credit card balance and I was charged yet again for the room. I immediately called and was apologized to once again, and told it would be addressed immediately. I followed up later in the week and the person I talked to seemed to not know any of the details of the case and it was clear the refund hadn't actually been processed. 2 weeks after the stay is what it took for it finally be resolved and all I got for my trouble was a hollow apology."

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for two nights and was taken aback by the amount of construction going on at the property. From the front door on, it is construction. I tried to avoid it somewhat by asking for the Club level or an outside facing room since I am a loyal Platinum Hyatt Passport Points member. Nothing was offered to me. I received an inside facing room and it was loud. The construction noise started before 8am and lasted beyond 9pm. As I was in my room, I thought for sure the construction would stop at 7, it didn't, then 8, it didn't, and still had some banging around after 9pm. Unacceptable if you ask me.The front desk staff were courteous, friendly, and efficient. A property of this level, I would hope would've had a dedicated doorman, but they did not. They only had a mess in their valet section. I had to walk to the street to get a cab.My assessment is that the priority was to get the construction completed, over the experience of the paying customers on property. I am loyal to Hyatts, but this was certainly a poor experience that had no consideration or added value for loyal customers willing to still stay at their property during a major renovation that was an inconvenience and mess. They simply didn't do enough to compensate for the construction and to take care of loyal customers."

        "review_text": "A partial kitchen really meant no kitchen at all. Our room held a dorm size fridge and microwave. There was NO cook top and NO dishwasher. Although the appliances that were there appeared new it was just not enough for a week-long stay. The room was also lacking other basic kitchen goods such as a tea pitcher, measuring cups, dish cloths and dish towels. With no dishwasher how would I know the dishes were really clean? I had to wash them all by hand before we used them.We asked for another room with a full size fridge. The young man at the desk indicated rooms were available. But after \"checking\" with the manager we could not change rooms unless we paid an extra nightly fee (this was a time share exchange). The manager did not come out to speak with us personally which I found troubling and quite frankly, offensive.The entire suite was extremely DARK. Applying makeup in a dark bathroom is quite frustrating.The air conditioning unit was inconsistent and we could never keep an even temperature. It was either very cold in the bedroom (with the air blowing right on the bed) or hot and stale. Without the air blowing the room had a strange musty smell (perhaps smoke or animal odor). Be aware that they do allow pets because we heard a dog barking in the next room. WARNING: if you need a non-smoking room be sure to ask for it because they have both. I think our room previously housed a smoker even though there were no ash trays. I suffered with allergy attacks the whole time I was there. It could have been the poor air quality, pet dander or smoke.Sadly the safe did not work.We were in tower 1 with a view of the pool area. At first glance the view was nice but we found out early the next morning it was not such a great place because we were awakened by noise from the people in the pool.On a positive note the resort was conveniently located and we appreciated the shuttle service. Overall the room was clean. We were surprised (not in a good way) that a mid-week cleaning was provided.A few years ago we stayed at the Grandview which is bit further from the strip but they have a shuttle as well. I would definitely go back there next time."

        "review_text": "Staying at this hotel was truly one of the worst experiences of my life. It is unfathomable how this hotel continues to do what they do and get away with it. A sheer embarrassment of a hotel in one of the nicest areas in Chi TownWe checked in during what appeared to be a very busy day. We take a noisy elevator up to a smelly floor. Upon entering the room, we discover our room has a queen bed. I had booked a king bed. The front desk never bothered telling me we weren't going to get the room we booked. I pay a visit to the front desk who promptly tells me there are no king bed rooms available at that time as their hotel was full the night before. Not sure what that meant since it had been hours since the noon check-in time. Over the course of the next couple of hours, I continued to call the front desk; they kept telling me they had no idea whatsoever when a king bed room would open up. We had dinner plans that evening so I eventually gave upUpon entering the room we discovered it to be extremely hot and hot air was just blowing. The thermostat regulator was simply a knob that went from cooler to warmer. We moved the setting to cooler but to no avail; hot air continued to blow. Eventually we gave up and shut the thermostat offLater in the night, we discovered the bathroom floor to be wet; the sink was leaking. We had to throw towels on the floor to mop up. Then the kicker; the bathtub had something black strewn towards the entire length; appeared the sewer had backed upAt this time I was entirely repulsed; however it was late and we had an early start the following morning.During checkout, I asked to speak to the manager and was asked to wait. After several minutes I realized the front desk simply forgot about my request."

        "review_text": "The EDGEWATER, now called the MARRIOTT VACATION CLUB was a total surprise for us at arrival. The day we arrived, the owners of the hotel had changed although most of the previous staff was still the same. We booked a 2 bedroom suite which is a fabulous suite on the 4th floor. Very convenient when traveling with your children.Due to the new structure everything was a bit rougher to get rolling. Check-in took longer due to a new system that had been put into place and we got the feeling that the regular staff being assisted by Marriott staff putting everything into place were kind-off lost and insecure. Being in the travel industry business we were flexible on this end, not withstanding that we just had been flying for over 18 hours.Unfortunately where we had less understanding was with house keeping. In all of our previous stays this was never an issue, but this time it really was and we had a hard time understanding the why's as it was the same staff as in the past. Some examples, when cleaning the room everyday, only on 4 days out of the 11 days of our stay they cleaned the coffee pot. 4 out of 11 days they forgot to add the coffee in the room. A coffee machine without coffee is useless. Bathroom amenities, we had 2 bathrooms and only one would get replenished. Toilet paper, probably considered \"white gold leaves\". On several occasions the little paper left on the rolls was not removed which is OK but then at least leave some spare rolls. Had to run to the front desk to get some. Breakfast was as in the past, as long as the previous staff was preparing everything,  things rolled without a hick-up. When it was the newly hired staff, it was just not what we were used to. As mentioned these are operational issues which need guidance and streamlining again. The above are minor issues but important to be corrected.Nevertheless, we will be back at the now Marriott Vacation Club! We had a FABULOUS time in Miami and at the hotel and one thing that really needs to be said is that the hotel has an extremely friendly and helpful staff and very reactive to any needs you might have. Everyone of the staff had the right attitude to make their clients feel at home away from home.We're all looking forward to our next stay again !"

        "review_text": "I stayed for three nights over New Year\u2019s weekend. Despite being very excited to stay at the W brand for the first time, I left disappointed.The hotel is in a great location right off of Lake Michigan and is a short cab ride (or medium walking distance) from sites such as Michigan Ave., River North, Navy Pier, etc. The view from the rooms are picturesque and either face downtown or Lake Michigan. The staff is also friendly\u2014from the front desk staff, to housekeeping, to the bell desk. Unfortunately, that is where the good ends.The rooms are on the small side and the bathrooms are a major problem. The bathrooms are super tiny, with minimal counter space. They also aren\u2019t particularly clean (don\u2019t look at the sprinkler heads for example). There also is a window from the bathroom that faces the bedroom, and at certain angles, you can see into the bathroom from the bedroom (if privacy is a concern). The sliding bathroom door doesn\u2019t close completely either (if privacy is a concern). The closets are actually just an indention in the wall with a see-through curtain over it (pretty flimsy and cheap). The one robe they provide in the room was worn and tattered. The beds are on hard side and the mattresses seem old. There aren\u2019t any plugs next to the bed to charge your devices. They don\u2019t have refrigerators in the room but are available on a first come-first serve basis. No pen and paper in the room. Not enough dresser space.The worst part was on our last night there was a shooting at the hotel. We arrived back at the hotel late at night (around 2 a.m.) and there were many sketchy people loitering in the lobby. Not long after we got back up to the room, we heard gunshots. As it turns out, there was a shooting right at the hotel. While I can\u2019t blame the hotel for the shooting, it does speak to the type of guests at the hotel and the safety and security of staying there. They also didn\u2019t notify guests of the incident either that night or the morning after.I\u2019m sure there was a time when this hotel was luxurious and trendy, but those days are over. The hotel is now worn and tired. You add in the questionable safety factor, and I strongly suggest you stay at another hotel in the area. For the price, you can get a hotel in the same area for less money and more luxury, and hopefully no gunfire."

        "review_text": "We've been Owners at Tahiti Village for 8 years but this was our FIRST time actually staying at this Resort.  We had 2 One Bedroom Bora Bora Units for 2 weeks while my husband was here on business. (FYI - there are 2 types of One Bedroom units)  This unit is Big with a full kitchen, Living Room and Bathroom with Jacuzzi Tub and Steam Shower.  There's a washer and dryer although they are Insanely Loud and don't work well.  We don't like strangers in our room while traveling so not having Cleaning Service was fine.  When we wanted new towels, we just had them replaced.  The grounds are beautiful, the pools are lovely and there are grills everywhere which really makes us happy since we tend to do most of our cooking and go out to eat only a handful of times.  Most of the Staff were very Friendly and Helpful.  The Shuttle Bus is a nice perk for getting to the strip or to get groceries without having to pay for a taxi.  Now...  for the bad.  We were invited to an \"Owners Meeting\" and would get tickets to a show for our time.  Tahiti Village has gone through changes since we purchased it, like a Bankruptcy and change in Ownership.  My husband said he was interested in learning more about what happened and what the changes were.  We went to the 90 minute meeting which was just a tour and information on RCI and Points. (when we bought, they were with Interval International who we Love and are not interested in RCI or getting more points)  At the end, the Push guy was brought in to \"answer questions\".  This guys was Rude, Abrupt and NOT interested in answering questions!!  After just a couple questions he said, \"Is there going to be a SALE today or NOT??!!!\"  When we said we were happy with what we already had, he jumped up in Disgust, Disrespectfully \"Thanked\" us and walked away.  Seriously??  This is how you treat your OWNERS??  We've NEVER been treated SO RUDELY!!!  We understand pushy sales people (my husband is in sales) but this was completely unacceptable!!!  We were So Impressed with this Resort and eager to return...  but now, we are leaving with a Very Bad Taste in our mouth.  My husband owns a business and said he would have FIRED that guy on the SPOT!!  Tahiti Village needs to be as Concerned about the Sales People who 'Represent' them as they do about how Nice the Resort is.  Come here for a nice vacation, but keep AWAY from the Sales Presentation or \"Owners Meetings\"!!  (SO Disappointed with them and will NOT return soon)"

        "review_text": "I stayed in your hotel from August tenth to the twenty fourth. It was an amazing stay. I loved the rooms and everything else. This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in my life.There is a lot of water fun because it is near the beautiful beach. This was perfect for my young family. We all loved Dolphin quest and swimming. The dolphins were calm when I went in the water to greet them. It was extremely fun when I got to feed the dolphins. I loved swimming in the pools and beaches too.Also, there was great restaurants that I got to eat in. I loved eating at the seaside grill. The food was delicious. I enjoyed my meal while looking at the amazing view of the sea.The room was very clean and it had an amazing view outside. The bed was cozy and fluffy. The beds were clean too. Also, the room had a lot of decorations. The bathroom was very clean and it was treated very well.I also visited the gym and it was very clean and it had lots of good equipment for working out. The gym was a great place to visit because I could work out my body.I loved to take a walk in the garden because I could see beautiful flowers and I could smell the flowers which smell amazing. I loved the trees and I loved to walk around the garden.In addition, I loved the facilities were kind and they were good English speakers. The maids were kind and she cleaned the room whenever I hang the CLEAN ROOM sign. The chef was excellent at cooking and the front desk was very kind to me when I checked in for my stay.In conclusion, I enjoyed my stay and I would like to come again soon."

        "review_text": "We have just returned to Australia after spending 15 days in Hawaii ( first time in Hawaii). I am so pleased we chose to stay at Park Shore. The location is fantastic- not as busy as further down the street, however, everything such as shops, restaurants, and beach activities are still close by and easy to walk too. Further, the ocean, garden and Diamond Head views are absolutely stunning.We stayed in a suite, it was so beautiful! The room living area, bathroom, and bedroom were large, beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. The heated toilet seat was a lovely bonus novelty!I particularly loved how the hotel didn't try to gauge more money out of you for beach chair hire, a lovely surprise. There was also always plenty of shade and available lounge chairs at the pool area. The pool area was not the most dramatic and aesthetic compared to some of the pools at hotels we stayed. Also because there is no restaurant or catering at the hotel you could not order snacks or drinks to enjoy poolside. But really the beach is amazing and just a stone throw away, with either garden grass area to sit on ( if you hate sand) or sand areas to sit at, so this is the preferred place to for swimming.The reception staff and concierge were extremely friendly and helpful whilst retaining a casual disposition, always giving a smile and a friendly wave.Oh,  and by the way don't be put off by the foyer.  Personally, upon arrival, I thought it looked a little tired. For example stained carpet in areas. The day we arrived we one lift wasn't working and there was broken furniture under the stairway. This was all fixed within 12 hours of us staying there. We are already talking about going back to Hawaii and will definitely stay at Park Shore again!"

        "review_text": "The Equus is a great place to stay for a variety of reasons.  It starts at the beginning, the front desk personnel of Renee and Puka were friendly and helpful.  The rooms and the bathrooms are clean and fresh.  The beds are comfortable.  But it is also being at the beginning of Waikiki, just a hop skip and a jump to so many places.  Their is dining, fine dining, convenient ABC store, coffee shops, the Ala Moana Beach park for running and Ala Moana Shopping Center for shopping.  It is close drive or cab to Downtown Honolulu for work or into the heart of Waikiki for fun and pleasure.  Yummy MaiTai' s on Friday is a plus.  Lots of reasons to stay.  The only draw back is the one elevator, but there is a stairwell for those willing to get some exercise."

        "review_text": "This is a hidden gem in Honolulu, away from the bustle of Waikiki but with close access to it. The nicest beach in the areas. Rooms are affordable and some have outstanding views of the ocean. They are immaculate and well appointed. Housekeeping was excellent. The Hau Tree Lanai (an iconic restaurant) is still outstanding and popular - make reservations to avoid disappointment. Although the 4th time to Miyako restaurant on the 2nd floor, I found the food disappointing and not as good as I remembered. The Sunset Lounge is excellent with wonderful food (best Angus burgers in the world) and drinks. But what really marks this hotel is the staff: Jun Gonzaga and Ted Teruya have really developed a culture of excellent service and they should be most proud of Laurie, Chad, and Patty. These three people made us feel at home and made us most welcome. It felt like leaving family when we left a few days ago. I could not have asked for better service. Thank you."

        "review_text": "This may be an unfair comparison.  We came from a very nice and quiet resort on Maui in Makena.   We stayed one night so we could go to Pearl Harbor first thing in the morning.They gave us an upgrade to an ocean front room, which was very nice.   Second floor, in the front of the building.   We found the room to be on the small side, and of course, pie shaped as the hotel is indeed a circle.Beds were kind of hard, and the air conditioner was noisy.   As I mentioned earlier, we came from a luxury, quiet resort.   Here we were front and center on the main boulevard.  Lots of foot traffic and car traffic.They agreed to give us a late check out  of 1:00 as were part of a tour for Pearl Harbor.  Our tour bus was a bit late and we got back to the hotel at 1:20.   The front desk guy looked very angry as we were late.  (20 minutes).  We told him we'd be out in 5 minutes.All in all, good location as it is directly across from the beach.   Close to shopping (ABC store on each side of the hotel!!!)We would do things different had we known."

        "review_text": "I stayed in a studio at the Polo Towers for 12 nights and I loved it.The location is the biggest asset of the resort. You can come and go to and from the Strip as you wish, it is just a 2 minutes' walk away. I was lucky enough to have a studio overlooking the Strip and at night the view was gorgeous with the lights of the Aria, Cosmopolitan and Mandarin across the street. The downside was the noise when the window was open but I didn't mind at all.The studio is small but there is absolutely everything you need: coffee-maker, micro-wave, fridge, plates and cutlery for two, dish soap and even some washing powder for your laundry with the washer and drier you can use for FREE.The only items I thought were missing are chairs and a table on the balcony. I've been told that it is because people tended to throw them out, which is sad but not that surprising In Vegas unfortunately.The service is flawless. You need something, you call, they come very quickly with what you asked for and room service will call a few minutes later to make sure someone came.The staff is very nice. Wifi is good. Everything is clean and tidy.There is a small convenience store downstairs where you can buy drinks and some food, it's open until midnight. For longer stays and when you don't have a car, there is a complimentary shuttle that will take you twice a week to a grocery store on Flamingo. The same comfortable shuttle will take you Downtown (Fremont Street) and to a shopping mall also twice a week.The pool is on the top floor. It's \"only\" the 22nd floor but since there is no close building around, the view is incredible. You have to go there at dusk when the lights start to come up in all the hotels around, you won't forget it.The pool itself is not that great. It is small and not deep at all (3 feet). That's why there are so many children using it, which is unexpected since there is a specific pool for kids downstairs, and honestly, highly annoying. This is certainly the weak point of the place. If you want to have a chance to swim without being splashed or hit by a ball, you have to come very early in the morning. Not good for Vegas. I think it should be an adult-only pool.Another weak point, this time in the studio: the studio is also the second bedroom of a suite that can be rented to accommodate several people. When the studio is rented by itself like in my case, a simple door separates it from another one-bedroom apartment. It's unsetlling at first - what is this door? What if someone opens it? And also, you can hear your neighbors speak or watch TV and it's a real nuisance. I understand the convenience of having 2 small apartments that can be reunited but greater attention should be given to make that door a real, soundproof separation so that we feel in better privacy and safe.But anyway, I'll stay there again as soon as I can!"

First, they are on the second floor (there aren't any rooms on the first floor and you don't want to lug your stuff up the steps to the 3rd floor). Second, these three have a sink in each (so you don't have to use the public sink in the hall. Third, they each have an outer window (some rooms have \"fake\" inner windows). And fourth, each of these rooms has a chair to set your luggage on (very impt. as these rooms are all tiny!) The beds are literally as hard as a rock! We do indeed like a hard mattress but this truly felt like we were sleeping on the floor. A paper in the room said the mattresses are new... Lol! New but cheap. Our shoulders and backs hurt the next day. The place is very clean - very old but very clean. My main problem (why we will never return) is because of the smell! Do you know what \"port o johns\" smell like? The portable toilets they have at outdoor concerts and carnivals? The toilets and shower stunk so badly of - whatever that \"cleaner is\" I was dry heaving in the shower! Disgusting! To make matters worse,  literally as soon as you walk in the front door of the place you get hit in the face with the deodorizer - and it lingers throughout the place. I'm sure the owner will write a four page comment after my review telling you about all the glowing reviews but - I speak the truth. If you are \"smell sensitive\" (or claustrophobic) don't stay here. Otherwise you will be fine for a night or two."

I have stayed in couple other places including Westin St Francis (2x) and I loved Loews Regency more and I am probably going to pick this place over others.I liked this place for many reasons:1) location.. it is almost in the heart of SF but still away from the numerous tourists and cars unlike Union Square and vicinity.2) staff... we got a welcome drink, she was very polite and friendly.. knew exactly what I was looking for in a room3) this hotel has guaranteed views because the rooms start from Floor 38 (or something) and is the tallest residential/hotel tower!4) water bottles complimentary, they gave us extra bottles on 31st night which was great.. unlike Westin.. if you don\u2019t get a room under SPG they don\u2019t give bottles of water?? Really? I was parched on my stay with Westin!5) amazing views!"

        "review_text": "The building is a truly magnificent piece of architecture, in my opinion.  However, I wish the bathrooms would have been upgraded during the renovations. The bath cabinetry and tub/shower combo remind me of my grandmother's home, circa 1970 something.In addition, my service experience was a little spotty, but I shared it with the manager and he graciously did his best to resolve the issues.From what I could tell the hotel appears to have a lot of repeat guests.   If I were to visit again, I'd opt for the club floor as the rooms are quieter and you can take advantage of the lounge where food and beverages are available throughout the day.  The food is decent, although I wouldn't rate it anything out of the ordinary.My personal view is that the property may not have the cache it once had, but I'm glad I stayed there -- if nothing else for nostalgic reasons.  My aunt used to be a guest at the SFRC in the 70s and 80s when she traveled on business, she would share stories about the opulence of the property and the hotel's superb service. Accordingly, I went there with hopes of having the same experience, but that wasn't the case.  The hotel, in my opinion, could benefit from some additional updates (telephones, bathrooms) and service tweaks, but all of that is subjective. I suppose I expected a little more attention to detail would have gone into certain items/areas of the guest rooms and hotel experience, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from visiting.  The bed was comfortable and the neighborhood is lovely.I doubt I'll return any time soon as I continue to search for the perfect place to park myself when I visit the Bay Area, but it's definitely worth considering if you're planning a visit to SF."

        "review_text": "There\u2019s nothing much wrong about this hotel. It\u2019s just that I expected it a little too much after my booking. Just some photos from booking sites make me think of the scenario \u2018expectations VS reality\u2019 -I gave it four stars because I think that\u2019s not the hotel\u2019s fault that I had such high expectations. The location was superb. Less than 5 minutes to Phormphong BTS and super close to high end malls (Emporium, Emquatiers). Feel safe at night and yeah ! Will I return to this hotel again. Maybe with a different room types :)One more thing, on the day I arrived (probably around 4pm 09th AUG 2018), the guy (in the middle counter) who checked me in and lady staff (on his right) werent too pleasure to be with. I felt a little bit uncomfortable with them. Having been to few 5stars hotels, I think they are off standard."

        "review_text": "I stayed in room 1522 and it is definitely, without a doubt, haunted. I'm an open minded skeptic and I never had a paranormal encounter until I stayed here. My first night here went fine and I slept without any problems. On my second day, I had a weird experience with my electronic devices during the daytime. I thought it was odd but I shrugged it off. When I got back that night, things got weird again. Coincidentally, I'd just gotten back from a ghost tour and I brought back an electromagnetic field detector with me so I used it. It kept spiking like crazy whenever weird things happened. My electronic devices started acting weird again. The room phone also had a message from the front desk from a week ago that hadn't been there when I left. (It was a call from housekeeping letting the previous room occupants know that they couldn't access the room for cleaning and to call and let them know they needed anything. Perhaps the maids don't like cleaning this specific room.)I experienced something cold touching me and my traveling companion repeatedly, on and off all night. She's sensitive to paranormal energy and I am not. When we complained to the front desk, they sent security up to check it out and the electronics acted weird in front of the guard too. Along with the electronic weirdness and cold phantom touching, things got even weirder as the night progressed. Whatever was in there with us seemed to get stronger because we saw a white mist, smelled old burning wood, and heard phantom crying or laughter from a woman we couldn't see in the room.Finally around 2:00am, we just couldn't take it and we took all our stuff down to the lobby. We got a different room around 2:30am. The night manager was very disrespectful towards us though. He told us we were crazy but we know what we experienced. It's pretty humiliating to have to ask for a room switch due to paranormal activity. He didn't need to make us feel worse about it.On the upside, here are the pros of the hotel:- excellent central location within walking distance to great shopping and dining- clean rooms with a nice bathroom and comfortable beds- Neutrogena toiletries provided- refrigerator and microwave  provided in room so you can save leftovers and reheat if neededCons:- expensive valet parking. Do the self parking at the garage next door.- Or pro if you're into this kind of thing. HAUNTED ROOM!"

        "review_text": "My husband and I picked this hotel due to the location of where we wanted to be. I have been to Vegas several times and I have to say this hotel is very nice and I am glad I didn't let other reviews on here persuade me in a different direction. The rooms are spacious and the beds a comfortable and I didn't have any issue with the noise below from the street, most everything was finished by about 2am-230a.I would definitely be back to stay again. I enjoyed the comedy show at the Jokester comedy club. Of course we played the slots, we didn't come out big winners but bought back some of our cash lol.. I didn't get a chance to try the steak house and or the deli on the property because we had other lunch/ dinner reservations during our stay but when I come back in a few months I will be trying both. I will say the McDonald's  on site is fast and efficient and the staff seemed to be having a good time at 3am even with drunk people all around! I absolutely loved the atmosphere of this hotel."

        "review_text": "OK I have stayed at some amazing hotels and some terrible hotels.  This hotel was more than terrible, it was a complete nightmare.We made the terrible mistake of ignoring reviews as so many said the rooms had great views but the service was terrible.  We now realize that great views do not make a hotel.Let me run through a few of the issues -> but keep reading to the end, it gets stunningly bad.We booked a room with two beds.  The room was not the room in the photo and although it had two beds, they were not together.The staff basically ignored you or where rude.The rooms had holes in the walls.None of the lights worked including all of the side lights apart from one small light in the roof.On the first night we were kept awake all night by the couple next door (with a lot of stamina).The walls are paper thin so you can hear everyone in the corridor.NOW HERE GOES -> If you have a car, you have to use their valet service.  We dropped our car off at around 11.30pm.  At 4.30am we had a knock on the door then security let themselves into the room, turned all the lights on then asked us where are car was.  We then spent all morning running through the security tapes.  At about 1.30am the valet service gave our car to someone else.  When asked about it and when the police asked about it they said that they had not had the car, even when they were shown the security tapes.In fairness, the only useful people there where the security. Everyone else at this hotel and everything about this hotel is terrible.  For you own sake, don\u2019t book here.  You would be more comfortable sleeping rough."

        "review_text": "When we tried to check-in this hotel they said my credit card was not working (insufficient funds) although it had may be 6 times more credit than the hotel bill. So I tried another credit card and they said the same thing and I insisted that they might have a problem with their system but they didn't agree. As a last resort, I used another credit card that I had never used before (I just used to account that was associated to the credit card to buy a flight ticket from the same flight company that had issued me the credit card) and they said the same thing. I was there with my friend so we paid the bill with his credit card. Almost after a month suspicious payments were made from my friend's credit card and same thing happened to me after a while. All 3 credit cards (one is particular that I didn't used to pay anything except a flight ticket) were stolen. At first we thought it might not be the hotel but I have 8 different credit cards and only 3 of them that I tried to pay the bill were stolen and one of them was only used in that hotel. I wrote my complaints to the hotel but no answers so far. I haven't thought to write here but when I saw suspicious payments on my credit that that has been only used in that hotel, I wanted to write here. So be alert in order not be a victim of credit card fraud."

        "review_text": "This was our first visit to Hawaii and of course to the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. We were excited by the presentation of the entrance foyer, it was grand, modern and very impressive. It was from here that the dissapointment began.After an 11 hour flight, 1 hour to get through customs and a 45 minute shuttle service to the Sheraton, we were greeted at reception with \"we don't have a reservation in our system for you\".Shock horror, despite having documentation showing our reservation it took nearly an hour for the young guy to find us a room which was supposed to be equal to what we had paid for. We were put on the 29th Floor in a room that looked like it had not been renovated since the 80's and the bathroom was well in need of some work. The room had a view of the city but the promised ocean view was only visible if you leant forward or looked around the corner. Surprised and DissapointedFor our inconvenience??????, we were offered a free breakfast for two and two free cocktails. The breakfast was dissapointing in that the bacon was rock hard, the juice watered down to the max and birds flying/landing in the uncovered fruit platters on display. I'm glad it was free because it saved the staff further complaints. When we reported the birds in the fruit platters, they were moved but we did receive a smug look from the lady who we pointed this out too. Also during breakfast, we observed and heard two female staff members arguing over who was responsible for doing what at a certain time. This occurred in front of all the customers seated ( about 6) at the time. Very unprofessional. Surprised and DissapointedWhilst looking to confirm a tour the following day with the Concierge, we were advised that this was not her job and we should do it from our own room where it was free. Surprised and Dissapointed.On the positive side the two ladies who looked after the both of us at the Splash Pool Bar were amazing. Lea and Angie (I think) were there to do anything they could to make our stay enjoyable. Great Service ladies.The bed in the room (King Size) was brilliant.With an upgrade to facilities the Sheraton could be a great place to stay whilst in Hawaii. Close to just about everything in Honolulu.With the Surprise and Dissapointment with our stay, the best I can rate is an Average but things could be so much better.As can be seen from my previous posts, it is rare that I provide negative feedback but I'm sorry Sheraton, it had to be done on this occasion.Mahalo"

        "review_text": "I booked this hotel 1-2 months in advance with EXPEDIA FOR 430 for 1 room 2 beds and received an email confirming FREE COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST AND PARKING. I ARRIVED Friday, turns out there is NO FREE OR parking available for their guest. BUT THEY DO OFFER YOU VALET parking FOR 69.00 per day. WE, INCLUDING A BABY, were given 2 address for \"free parking\" ELSEWHERE, turns out 1 is for IN N OUT parking lot the 2nd parking address was for Starbucks. We head back to the hotel after 20 minutes of driving around and the valet person offers TO ONLY CHARGE ME A  25.00 fee FOR MY CAR. The rooms view was the back parking lot of Ross and world market. There is no one to help you carry your bags to your room, the elevator they do have was on the other side of my room. I asked for the pool to be close to my room turns out is on the opposite side of my room. At 7 am the next day there is a loud speaker going off, turns out boycott crew. I call the front desk to ask about breakfast..front desk was rude and upset because I didn't request or book my room with \"include breakfast \" so I had to take the rude attitude. Okay no big deal I ate breakfast elsewhere after being told \"that's Expedias problem not ours you need to talk to Expedia folks\" so I decide to take my car and Juan the valet person tells me about the misunderstanding and as of Friday I need to pay 69.00 a night. Dude I'm here until Monday. I call the front desk to get clarification ...I get a rude receptionist. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON WE WISH WE STAYED ACROSS THE STREET AT THE HOLIDAY INN!!! And to be honest the place is dirty..dusty bathtub looked yellow and the bath curtain had mole at the bottom. i can't take pics to prove it, I'm using their TV to write this review."

        "review_text": "We just returned from a wonderful week at the Outrigger Reef. Starting from the time of check-in we had an amazing experience. Staff were warm and accommodating of all our requests. We started off in a 1 bedroom city view suite which was a great size for 3 friends sharing the space (2 double beds and a pullout couch). Halfway through someone else joined us and we split up into 2 regular city view rooms. The staff helped organize for adjoining rooms and let us check in early so we could just transfer our stuff from one room to the other. On the last day we had a red-eye, so they were super accommodating with late check out and they also have hospitality suites so you can shower at the end of the day before your flight. The rooms were updated and clean and the beds were super comfy. You couldn't ask for a better location right on the beach and close to everything. Our favourite part was probably the afternoon happy hour at the pool - friendly staff and delicious Mai Tais! We had such a great time we are hoping to make it an annual trip and will definitely stay at the Outrigger Reef again!"

        "review_text": "Just returned from my 3rd visit to The Redbury and once again they met my expectations.First, let me tell you what they are not--they are not an oceanfront hotel. They do not have a nightclub or pool parties. They do not have gift shops or a gym like other full service hotels.What they do have is excellent customer service and large rooms without the price tag associated with these more full service or oceanfront hotels. However, they are just across the street from the ocean and your room charge gives you access to a beach chair, access to sister Raleigh and SLS Hotels--including use of the small gym at the SLS and instant, complimentary access to their nightclub (without paying extra for it). So if you do not mind walking a little, you will save a lot and get a bigger room out of the deal.They allowed me to check into my room following my redeye flight that got me to the hotel at 6:30AM, without charging me extra (depends upon occupancy level). Their front desk duals as a concierge and is always super friendly. Their rooftop pool is large enough and a great place to chill from the hipster crowds. Their new mediterranean restaurant, Cleopatra, is excellent and has the crowds to prove it, especially at night. Their location is less than a 2 minute walk, if that, to the ocean and about 5 minutes to Lincoln Road Mall. They do not have a business center, but I was here on a business trip and was able to print out a Word doc presentation for a meeting on their front desk printer by just sending them an email (also, at no charge). If you are looking for a more initimate boutique feel with warm customer service, The Redbury is the place to stay."

The San Francisco Palomar, however, is one of my favorite ones.

The rooms are some of the nicest we have stayed in and the staff as always is super friendly and accomodating. The rooms are totally quiet despite being right in the middle of everything.

This is definitely a family resort.You can always get a sun lounger which is good, because in some hotels this is impossible.It has a really good location - right on the beach and a 2 minute walk to the beachwalk restaurants.The rooms are spacious - we had one overlooking the pool and we could see the ocean.It was reasonably priced.  They have a good happy hour from 3-5pm.John is the poolside waiter and he was a lovely guy - very friendly!The hotel organises daily activities if you want to learn how to make a Lai or Hula dance.Shorebird is a great bar/restaurant within the resort.  You should check it out for sunset.Downfall - terrible WiFi signal!  We used Starbucks and put your Do not disturb on your door as the maids try to get into the room from 8am (kind of annoying when you are having a lie in and weren't aware to do this)"

        "review_text": "I wanted to stay in the Fairmont because of it is a well know and a historic hotel in San Francisco. It also is a beautiful building (and has a great lobby).We checked in Friday August 21st for a one night stay before an early flight back home (end of the vacation). The hotel (from the outside) is the best looking hotel in San Francisco.Our room had an adjoining room that had a door that connected the two rooms (in case a bigger party wanted to be able to open both doors). Our room was fine and normal but I noticed that because this is an old hotel the entire room and hotel felt stuffy (more on that in a minute).We were comfortable and enjoying our stay up until 4pm when the guests in the adjoining room arrived back (presumably from a night out on the town). The rooms that connected the two rooms made it easy to hear into the other room. They started to smoke up some week to end the night and the smell immediately made its way to our room. It was as if they were smoking in our room, after about 15 minutes our entire room was filled up. I tried to cover the adjoining room with a towel, tried to turn on the fan in the bathroom (no fan), and then tried to open the window (sealed shut). I resorted to opening the hallway door and was using the newspaper to fan the room a bit. We were leaving for our flight in about an hour so we sucked it up and got ready. This cut our sleep down by 2-3 hours total.We told the manager when we were in the lobby and she seemed more concerned with assuring us the other room would be getting a $250 cleaning fee (as if we cared if they did or did not). She did tell us that they would make a mark on our account so that we would not get a cleaning fee (thanks so much!)."

        "review_text": "We stayed in a club room so we could make use of the facilities.  The staff in the club were fantastic, Leo in particular, and went that extra step to ensure that you had a great stay.The room itself had a lounge area where our 2 children stayed on roll out beds, master room, large robe and ensuite and a powder room. The decor was fresh and smart.The only reason that I have given the hotel 4 stars is that it doesn't have a swimming pool and when organising a babysitter the hotel does not it organise it for you, you get a recommendation for an agency. They looked perplexed at the front desk when I asked for a babysitter making me feel that it is more a business based hotel.  This is the first five star hotel I have stayed in that does not book a babysitter for you. The Ritz Carlton in Singapore and HK do."

        "review_text": "I meant to write this a while ago but I didn't so here is my review now.  I stayed at the Carlton for 10 days during Super Bowl as I was in town for work.  Let me just saw the staff was so welcoming, friendly and just great!  Theo welcomed me like if I was walking into his home!  Loved the fact they have music every day including wine tastings as well.My room was super clean, it was very nice.  I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about my 10 days here, I walked in at different times and always felt at home.  If you don't want to valet, there is a parking garage that is literally 30 seconds away which is super convenient if you do not want to valet.   I also found an amazinnnng little bakery right around the corner called Mr. Holmes bakehouse, their sticky buns were out of this world, thank heavens I found them on my last day because if not I would have come home with at least 10 extra pounds.  Lots of great restaurants in the area if you know where to look.The only thing I would say for my extended stay is I would have like a small fridge in my room, perhaps these can be available per guest request?  Other than that, I would definitely stay here again and recommend the property to any of my friends looking for a place to stay!"

It probably was well kept and run in when it was built, 90 years ago, it is showing its age and needs a refresh. I ordered champagne and chocolate strawberries to be in our room upon our arrival. They were not. Eventually the champagne showed up but i had to ask for the strawberries. Our room cleaning had something missing every day. Towels, bag for ice, etc. The mirror on the door had dusty finger prints when we came that were only cleaned off the day before wee left."

        "review_text": "This was our 5th annual stay at the Hotel Vintage Court. Unfortunately, over the years, we have seen a decline in the amenities, condition and cleanliness of the rooms. Although the front desk staff was courteous, it did not make up for a disappointing experience. On our recent visit we stayed in an Executive King room which was small and dark. The room was hot and stuffy upon entering and the air conditioner was inefficient and the room remained stuffy throughout our stay. The carpet was stained in places, the furniture has seen better days and there was no clock in the room. The bathroom was small and the sink area was narrow, awkward and poorly lit. Additionally, the bathroom's paper products are low quality. My husband actually said \"if I didn't know where I was I'd think I was in a budget hotel.\" Sadly, I have to describe our room as seedy. Our earlier stays at the Hotel Vintage Court were delightful but we will not return."

The kids room has a king bed instead of 2 beds as requested and confirmed. There is major construction going on right outside the hotel. It\u2019s very disruptive and noisy. Can we have a room not overlooking this? non available. We weren\u2019t told of these works until our non refundable booking was confirmed. The hotel itself has had a major refurbishment, it\u2019s ok. The extra bed still hasn\u2019t arrived hours later, To say we are disappointed at having spent this amount of money for a noisy room, beach, etc doesn\u2019t cover it. The hotel can only apologise but that doesn\u2019t help, if you stay down the beach a bit in any of the other beautiful hotels you will pay less and actually have a relaxing holiday. Oh and we booked a massage, but the spa is under refurbishment. Well we tried the Jumeriah Beach, but we wouldn\u2019t recommend or come back."

Its location is perfect for visiting museums, parks, and historic landmarks of San Francisco. During our stay here, we walked to almost all the places we visited.The inn is classy and chic but not pretentious.When you arrive, you walk into a small but lovely decorated reception area. Once checked in, the staff will help with luggage and make sure you know the location of everything you might need at the inn.We stayed in a superior King Suite. To us, the hotel stay is as important as the place we are visiting. We love to have a seating area that is separate from our bedroom. The superior King suite gave us the room we like, plus it had a spa-like bathroom."

        "review_text": "$1100 for 5 nights. The room is so disappointing for the price. Very basic and old furniture. And NO Coffee Maker. Called front desk. Answer is 'we don't provide coffee maker'. No sorry or anything. Pretty indifferent.Also had wifi issue. I was told wifi is complimentary when checked in. Worked for day 1. It asked me to pay $12.99 for a day on day 2 so I called front desk. Was told 'hold on' and then transferred to IT. Again indifferent tone. IT checked and said didn't find my name but has a different name Browning for my room. I said that's not me and something wrong from their end but was told to try it. I tried Browning and no surprise. It is denied. Was told to restart browser and try Browning again. Denied again. Was told to restart computer and try again. It was denied again. Then he was asking my computer's MAC address which he doesn't know how I can get that info as an IT specialist. Fortunately, I was able to figure out myself. He then spent a while and said my internet should be good. I tried again and it was the same thing asking me to pay $12.99. He then said 'hold on'. After a while, I was told it is my computer problem because it shows from his end that I was connected. I said my computer worked and has no problem. He then said just choose the pay but the hotel will not charge me. It doesn't make sense for me. Why it asks me to accept to pay while it should be complimentary. He then asked front desk per my request and then told me try again and it should work. Yeah, finally after one hour, it worked as complimentary. I asked what happened. He said front desk forgot to add my stay as complimentary internet. Again 'No sorry' etc.I told front desk at first place that it should be complimentary. Why didn't she simply check from her end and then could just correct the mistake right there. Instead, forward me to IT. Again I told IT clearly the issue. He kept on going around and finally asked front desk and added my stay as complimentary interest which should be done at very beginning.Poor service and doesn't care customer. Will not come back."

The pool closes at 4:30 pm and does not open the following morning until 10 am. !!!!  I was absolutely frustrated and disappointed, as were the kids !  It was too late to get a refund on the room and we were exhausted from being on the road all day.The amenities are absolutely gorgeous, It's such a shame we were not allowed to use them .  Also, the restraunt on site was sub-par.Spent way too much money for a heated pool we didn't even get to use !! I'll stop in Mesquite next time ."

        "review_text": "2018-10-06Arrived at noon of Saturday.Check-in was normal. Lots of traffic in the lobby.We had a decent sized 2-BR unit from an II exchange. The MBR has a king size bed with huge bathroom. Typical sized shampoo, lotion, and soap was provided. 4 bath towels, hand towels and face towels were provided as well.Tub in MBR is a little bigger than normal. Water pressure is a tad less than it should be (amount of shower head's nozzle didn't help either). Worse is that the tub did not drain as fast as the shower head's water output... so you basically showering while your feet is soaking from your own dirt water.Same thing with the double sink  drain in MBR. Plus sink drain have knocking sound while it drains.Bed was normal. Pillows were soft and fluffy. Good thing!Blow dryer, safe, clothes chest, 2 night stands, and a 32\" flat screen was in the MBR.The other bedroom has a full size (or maybe a queen size) with a flat screen as wellThe living room has a queen pull out bed and a flat screen and dvd player. The TV has an extra HDMI input to connect your streaming devices.Kitchen has a full size fridge, gas stoves, sink, dish washer, and plates set service for 6 or 8. Cooking pots, pans, utensils, measuring cups, coffee (for 10 cups) were also provided! Small Liquid dish washing soap was provided but had to ask for a couple of automatic dish washing tablets.Staff were nice.The pool was NOT heated. I have read somewhere that the pool was heated with 4 slides (2 long and 2 short slides). 2 weekend nights we were there and the pool was FREEZING! We talked to 3 more families that shared are despair. We chose this resort because of the heated pool... because our teen and toddler loves pool... but all we got were children who were sniffling & coughing after spending couple of hours in the pool. The pools and the spas could also use some cleaning. You will see leaves and bugs on the edge of the pools. Several hot spas were located around the pool.Check out was a breeze.If you think this review helped you in any way, please give a thumbs up.Have a great vacation!"

I stayed with my family around the holidays, and we were able to walk over to see the 50 state tree + lights in about 10 minutes.The room was comfortable.  We stayed on an upper floor, so we didn't run into the issues that others saw with outdated rooms.  The indoor pool was a big plus with my kids.  The pool is bigger than what you'd see in a typical hotel.  Speaking of kids, the hotel ran a few interesting games for the them, such as a scavenger hunt, and they gave out Whitehouse tree ornaments."

        "review_text": "I made a complaint when I returned directly to Westin in mid-April 2015 but have received no response. This is disapointing. I booked a partial ocean view room directly through Westin's website as a SPG member paying more than on any discount website. The website also stated the room were newly refurbished. I was initially placed in the most appalling room. You had to hang off the balcony to see any ocean glimpse and in doing so the most immediate view was a tower of rooms in the adjacent hotel with people looking into my bedroom. Hence you would need to keep the curtains pulled for any chance of privacy. To the left was a big, dirty and noisy construction site- far more prominent than any partial ocean view. The room was dark and dingy even with  the blinds open as it was angled away from the beach. It was not newly refurbished as advertised- there were stains on the wallpaper and upholstery and it had a stale smell. It was like landing in a ghetto! The only saving grace was that I complained directly to Westin's head office as the hotel's mamager and customer service rep was incredibly rude- I was told among other things that I \"got what I paid for\", \"can't be upgraded because you are staying for 10 nights\" and they \"can't vouch for the decor of the room\". After persistence I was upgraded to an Ocean View Room that had an internal decor that you would expect of a Westin and a lovely view of the ocean . However, we remained unimpressed with the unfriendly customer service throughout our stay and the housekeeping throughout was poor on most occasions (no shower cap, no shower gel ever, missing towels, sloppy bed making....). So sad as it was at the polar extreme of the amazing and pampered experience I had when I stayed at The Westin Times Square for 2 weeks in February 2012 or the Westin in Denarau for a similar period in 2010. What's the point is being a loyal SPG member?"

        "review_text": "My wife and I flew into town for the weekend to attend a wedding at The Drake. Although we could've stayed there, we decided to check out the Four Seasons, which is right across the street. Unfortunately, our stay wasn't great. While the staff was generally friendly, we encountered some major (and minor) issues during our two nights there.Upon arrival outside of the hotel, we stepped out of our Uber (a black car), and instead of being greeted \"Welcome to the Four Seasons\", we were met with \"Are you here for the Four Seasons?\", and in a tone that made it seem as if we should be staying at some other hotel. That really got me thinking that maybe we already choose the wrong place.At this property, you have to take an elevator up to the 7th floor to check in and then another one to the room floors. I saw a few reviews that mention this is a pain, but as long as you budget a few extra minutes it's not a big deal. The Peninsula in Chicago is the same. The hotel lobby is very nice, but again as we got there, I walked up to the concierge desk, which is nearest to the ground floor elevators and there were two staff there chatting. I thought it was the check in, but they didn't really say anything, not even a greeting, and then I noticed the front desk was actually across the room. Would've been nice to point us in the right direction....We were checked in quickly as requested and shown the elevators to our room. The staff member who checked us in was very nice. I booked through Amex FHR and we received a suite upgrade, but the room was not really in great shape. The hotel seems old and our room was not really what I would expect from the Four Seasons. It seemed worn down, but I will say the view was spectacular. The bed was comfortable, but the bathroom was pretty small even for a suite. Our shower also didn't work, as the drain never fully let the water down and so we had a constant puddle in the shower that spilled into the bathroom. On the first night, I had also had to re-set our TV 4 times before it finally worked.When we got back from dinner, there was one, small water bottle on my nightstand even though there were two of us in the room. We tried calling down to the front desk to ask for more water, but of course the phone in the bedroom wasn't working. Luckily, we had a second one in the other part of the suite, and after we called to ask for some bottles, which were quickly brought up. Too bad we had to go through this to begin with....Two other issues, one major and one minor. The wifi never worked (minor) in our room at all. I was never able to connect.The major issue though, and this is what really makes me upset the more I think about it, is that while we were at breakfast, I was served a water glass with a broken piece of glass inside of it! That's right, a water glass with a sharp piece of another glass inside of it. It took some time before I realized it was in there, but luckily I did before I finished drinking, otherwise I might have ended up swallowing it and taking a trip to the hospital. We brought it to the waiter's attention, who was immediately apologetic. He then sent the manager to speak with us, who also was apologetic. They were both very friendly, and comped our meal (even though it was free anyways since I had booked with FHR).While this happening I wasn't that upset - I understand accidents happen. But when I really started to think about it, it's extremely dangerous. What if a child had been served that class and wasn't paying attention to what they were drinking? It could have ended much worse than it did.We told the front desk staff about some of these issues at check out, but I hate these interactions as I don't want it to seem like I'm fishing for a free night or something. But this was a pretty bad stay, and I'm not sure we will be returning anytime soon."

Also easy to access the Muni and Bart Powell station a few blocks away as well as all the shopping around Union Square. Really great restaurant on site and cool game area and bar area.  Nice unique rooms and mine was really quiet."

Our room was very tidy, and we couldn't hear our neighbors at all. Not sure why other reviewers mentioned this...BDK the new bar and restaurant is a very cool customer, we even had a really delicious breakfast.We used the hotel bikes and explored San Fran. A truly great day! Complete with polkadot helmets.And the way to this ladies heart is there nightly wine hour on the main floor living room."

        "review_text": "Stayed at Polo Towers in mid November 2016. Very good location just directly across the street from the Monte Carlo just behind a small courtyard and across a short street from a strip mall where they sell liquor and t shirts etc. The building very easy to locate and displays purple neon in the evenings. There is no casino here and no smoking so great for those of us who don't enjoy the smell of stale cigarette smoke. The room was very clean although we did find a business card from one of the \"girls\" behind the couch. We stayed in a one bedroom with a large bathroom and a complete kitchen. We were three with our son who slept on the roll out couch in the living area. The decor is yellow and tan so the room is bright and we loved the small balcony off the bedroom which allowed the fresh air in at night and in the morning. We were on the 21st floor with the pool just above on the 22nd and we had a laundry room across from us that also had the ice machine. Overall very convenient for us and the room was very quiet. We did not face the strip but found this relaxing so we did not mind that, every morning the view was the sun rising and the mountains in the distance. Laundry if free , if you need soap you can purchase that for a dollar a box. They supply you with one box in your room. Found this very convenient and the washing machines lock once they start in case you are worried about your laundry going missing. The dryers do not. The kitchens in the rooms are completely fitted with everything you need for the week including a blender for making drinks. Frying pans, spatulas, dishes for six , wine glasses, coffee pot with enough coffee for a few days. Bathroom is lovely with a big deep tub..no jets but that was fine. The hotel leaves soap, moisturizer, conditioner and shampoo. You will only need your toothpaste and toothbrush. The king size bed was very comfortable and fitted with soft sheets. There is a dresser there with two end tables, a safe, ironing board and iron. They also generously provided extra pillows and more blankets. The check in was friendly and fast and they allowed us in early when we arrived at lunch time instead of four o'clock , very nice as my husband has mobility issues and he needed to rest. They will keep your luggage for you if there are no rooms available and also if you need to stash your bags for a bit before you catch the flight home. I was told that they will store luggage for up to twenty four hours free of charge. On that note, the checkout time a bit early at ten but that was the only complaint I can think of. We spent some time at the roof top pool , its heated and a bit shallow at three feet but good enough to cool off on a hot day. There are plenty of lounges available and nice areas to stay out of the sun as well if you wish. They have a lookout deck and a hot tub as well.The pool area provides towels for you so no taking them from your room, You are allowed to bring your own drinks as well but beer/ coolers only allowed in cans, no glass which makes sense. They have cups available for you to use. The security and any cleaning staff are polite and helpful as are all of the people working there. They were very good to us and helped us in procuring a walker for my husband for the week.You can also get scooters there if you wish. We took the shuttle down to Fremont Street and this was provided by the hotel for free but we did tip him for his trouble , very friendly and informative about Las Vegas. They will take you down to the Golden Nugget but you will have to find your way back. This is not difficult as the Deuce bus runs about every fifteen minutes from two or three streets right off Fremont as you walk through. There are machines on the corners where you can buy your passes for one trip, 24 hours or whatever you need. It will take credit cards. Kind of an interesting look at the city on the way back but it is a slow drive and the bus is packed. They let us out almost directly across the street and if you want to catch the bus going to Fremont, the deuce is on the corner just steps from the front door of Polo Towers. The hotel has a small convenience store where you can purchase a few necessities like bread, milk etc. We chose to use the drug stores , CVS and Walgreens which are a very short walk from the hotel in either direction. The prices are ridiculous there but you are paying for the convenience of the strip and its easy to pick up treats and beer while you are there. The corner shop in the strip mall just steps from Polo Towers also has beer at a very reasonable price. The courtyard out front by the street has a bar if you are a fan of the slushy alcohol drinks. Everything very close to  Polo Towers and you are at New York, New York or the MGM in just minutes.There is a Dennys close as well if you enjoy a hearty breakfast and don't want to cook. Overall no complaints at all. Very conveniently located, clean,gym, nice staff, quiet and despite the other reviews here, no real push to purchase a time share, Of course they will stop you coming in and leaving at the end of your stay but just say no politely and move on.  I would recommend this to my friends and should we return to Las Vegas it is very likely that we would stay again."

(The Ocean House is pretty expensive but the food is of high quality)- Within walking distance to good restaurants and high-end stores- Free transportation on the shuttle to Diamondhead, and other tourist attractions- Friendly staff (front desk, housekeeping)Cons:- The cost for chair and umbrella rental at the beach area (they only have free chairs around the pool)- Our keys kept getting de-magnitized. After I phoned down to the front desk to send someone up, no one came so we had to go to the front desk- We had to keep logging into the Wifi. With a $30/day resort fee, we expected better Wifi."

        "review_text": "My family arrived at the Cancun resort on the evening of Sunday August 12, 2018.On arrival the member of staff at check in desk advised me that our room for 3 adults and 3 children (booked via Agoda) would not have enough beds to accommodate our family and that our children (including two disabled kids) would not have beds. When asked why there would not be enough beds, I was advised that we could have 20 people in the room if we wanted but they would have to sleep on the floor!!!!!When complaint was given I asked for the hotel manager, the front of house manager (Liana Castro) appeared and told us that they had no other room available, until she decided that they could offer us an \u201cout of service room\u201d with the required amount of beds for an extra $300!!At this point , 10.30pm on a Sunday night in Vegas , following numerous calls to diamond resorts corporate HQ that had ushanging on the line, we decided that we would no longer accept this level of service and any further undignified treatment and spent an hour arranging alternative accommodation at a much higher cost than our booking.As a visitor from Europe , I am accustomed to much better service from American corporations. Diamond resorts you should also give your desk staff some training when it comes to manners, being advised that my children could sleep on the floor is grossly offensive.Also being greeted by guests of your hotel on the front steps of your \u201cresort\u201d smoking weed really isn\u2019t what I would have expected from a so called family hotel. I await your response."

        "review_text": "First time staying at this hotel and a nightmare at the first day of check and now on communication. As a loyalty member of Accor and having reaching the status of GOLD with the intention of continuing to try for the next level of this membership but now seriously have to think twice. Before arriving at this hotel, did a 24 hours on line check in to speed up the check in process due to having to attend a meeting with a client but on the day of arrival which 12/09/2018, I have to wait 30 minutes to get my room key even when you have checked in on line. The front desk on duty as it seem did not know her job and having to swap my credit card the wrong way for more than 10 times until she realised her mistake. There was no apology from the front desk even after a short complaint. To make matters worst as I have to fly out of Bangkok to Cambodia for a meeting from 17/09/2018 to 19/09/2018 and will be back again to stay at the same hotel. As I have another meeting on 19/09/2018 when I arrive at Bangkok so I did a faster process by paying for my invoice on the morning of 17/09/2018 for the charges from 19/09/2018 to 20/09/2018 (for one night) so that I can get my room key faster when I arrive at the same hotel without having to reply the same mistakes by the front desk. Guess what the staff wrote to me an email and demanded more payment to my booking when I have the actual booking on hand via Accor Website which I have booked and the prices is clearly shown on the booking reference printed out. Not only that the person writing to me asking me for more payments and showing wrong check in date etc. I write back to her to check before coming back to me with such email but it seem they did not care to reply thereafter and when I ask for the email of GM of the hotel to explain why a hotel liked Mercure which is part of a great establishment brand name can have such mistakes made by a senior person at this hotel ? None of the staffs are willing to give me the email of this GM. I still having the unhappiness on this hotel service as why demand payment from me when the hotel should know what to expect from the guest. This is very annoying and frustrating and not forgetting the delay to get a simple check in process."

        "review_text": "I don't have high standards for hotels but the first room they put us in was not an ocean view despite paying extra for an ocean view. They said it's the penthouse. If you saw the shape of this room and the shared balcony you would wonder if they ever put anyone in this room. Plus you had to walk up stairs to reach it.After some debate and negotiating we paid extra for an corner ocean front view. This room still required a small set of stairs. The room had a funny odor and pealing wall paper. The room itself was quite large and had lots of space. Three private balconies and a great view of Waikiki and Diamond Head.I am glad we switched rooms even if it took extra money and negotiating.The amenities like the restaurants, pool and shops are nothing special. The pool is oddly located just behind the entrance from the street.The location of the hotel is the best part and this section of the beach had less people on it.Overall the only reason this gets a higher rating is due to the great location, beach access and view from the more expensive room."

Which is fine, but it was more of a angry face from 4 staff at the check-in and out counter.The cleaniness of the hotel were disappointing. I have stain my bathrobe and bedsheet with coffee. So I threw my bathrobe at the bathtub with all the dirty towels. I was thinking they were change a new one. After they make up my room, the bath robe were folded nicely on the bed. When I put it on I saw the stain again. I went to check the bedsheet, the stain have change from the bottom right to the upper left of the bed. There was water stain on the mirror that was not wipe. I have given them the chance for 4 nights. (I did not put the card to not change my bedsheet or towels).I have the habit of turning on the DND light, based on previous experience I should receive no calls or door bell. However, on the 10 Apr morning I received a incredible loud ring from the telephone which give me a shock from waking up just to check if they can come and make up the room. We have always turn off DND and turn on the make up room light whenever we leave the room.Their room service line is always busy and took more than the standard 3 rings answer. When we call the operator, the operator says its their standard operating procedures not to transfer call to the room service. I have to call them myself. The first order (our first night) we had was alright just that we had to put the tray outside our room after we are done eating. Although I have seen this but never done it myself. The housekeeper will always clear it when they are making up the room but we do as we were told. Our second order (our second night) was just drinks and we requested for a set of cutlery which cost us 50Baht. It is not alot of money but as a hotel we so much facilites and rooms they couldnt give us a cutlery. Which we didnt buy their cutlery from them and eat with out hands. We left the cups in our room as the room service did not tell us to leave it outside our room. One cup was left in our room for the remaining 2 nights.Upon check-out was worse, it took so long because they have to send someone to the room to check if we consumed anything from the minibar (there is only 2 beers and 1 mineral water in the fridge) and if the keycards were in the room. When they could only find one card they asked me where was the second keycard which was accidentally kick under the bed. I have friends which keep keycards as souvenirs I told her my experience and she was shocked to hear they need to see 2 keycard before letting us check out."

The hotel is beautiful, clean, quiet, but not so high class that we might feel uncomfortable like some of the others in the area.  The pool is busy, but accomodating, We get the partial beach view room that has a nice balcony for morning coffee or evening ocean listening.  The best part is the lively outdoor bar/restaurant area that has live local talent playing music every evening until 9:00.  Also love the local dancers that will show up and do a hula dance.  The gift shops are nice and affordable too.  Love the Reef!!!"

        "review_text": "I booked 3 x Junior Suites recently on a trip to Bangkok in May 2015 with my friends and the experience is less than ideal. The only plus point of this hotel is the proximity of BTS - Chong Nonsi, otherwise the following would be it's negative points:1) The reception area felt like an dodgy underground pimp shop (Geylang - as Singaporeans will know)2) The reception staff were unfriendly3) Upon checking into the room, there was a giant dead cockroach in the bathroom (see enclosed pic)4) Layers of dust on the window sills, blinds, table tops, windows (windows were dusty inside and out, looks like they haven't been cleaned for months or years!)5) Rotting wooden floor at the corner + wall stains due to air-con water leakage.6) We were \"upgraded\" to Executive Deluxe room after the cockroach incident, the rooms were slightly better but the cleanliness of the room is once again in question. Layers of dust all over, water marks stain on the toilet walls/sinks, air conditioner that makes \"gurgling\" sounds in the middle of the night, water that doesn't flow to the water trap in the shower because of bad design, hence a pool of water gets collected at your feet while showering.7) On checking out, the reception claimed we made a phone call to Canada and wanted to charge us for this. They had a time recorded when in fact we were out at that time at the night market? After 20mins of back and forth, they claimed it was a mistake??We were so disappointed with almost every aspect that we didn't even want to step into their cafe for breakfast to avoid further disappointment. This hotel looks like a new hotel but yet the management has failed in basic house-keeping hence the interior deteriorates at a much quicker pace. We paid about SGD120 per night (Junior Suite) which I believed could have gotten us a better and cleaner place elsewhere. The surrounding area was a business district so there weren't much night activities, the nearest was Sala Daeng - one BTS stop away which had shopping, restaurants and street markets. Overall, the stay was unpleasant and I would not ever recommend it to any of my family or friends. I will also strongly dissuade any travelers with young children as hygiene is the hotel's main weakness."

        "review_text": "I'm a huge Fairmont fan, as evidenced by several other reviews I have written, so it was with great anticipation that I headed to the Fairmont San Francisco for a National Convention I was attending. I organized my whole group and we had a courtesy Balcony Suite for entertaining.Loved the building. It is a grand old hotel refurbished enough to make it feel fresh but not loose any of the character that comes with such a building. The Nob Hill location is central and the perch it sits on gives you an opportunity for many different vista's. Our balcony suite had a decent city view with water views thru an alley between the main building and the Tower and some beyond the skyline. Probably the least appealing available for the few Balcony suites, but nonetheless, not tragic. I can only imagine how dramatic a view from the back of the hotel can be overlooking the Bay. I really loved the property and the recent renovation of the 3rd floor was done extremely well and lent an elegance to the accommodations.After many years as an exclusive Ritz Carlton client, I was lured to Fairmont with a 5 hotel stay over 2 weeks in Western Canada. What an amazing run that was and uniformly from Pacific Rim, to Whistler, to Jasper, Lake Louise and the amazing Banff Springs property, our contact with the Fairmont staff was amongst the best we have ever received... Fairmont may want to consider taking their name off of this building until they can affect the type of culture change necessary for such a prestigious property and bearing the Fairmont name.Off the top of my head, here are some instances....- The Doorman are atrocious. In fact, as I was leaving this morning it was unattended at the door. Not only do they not greet you, but in at least a couple of cases, they stood around chatting with each other and other waiting drivers as my driver worked to get into the portico and ultimately open our doors... This is your first contact and it is a clear indication of an uninspired staff that walks like zombies throughout the property.- Any greeting of a client is a rarity through the property. That is culture through many luxury properties in this competitive hospitality world.- There was a line at the desk as 2 young ladies attempted to move as fast as they could during what appeared to be a busy check in time. The desk was clearly undermanned, but I had no fear as I am a Presidents Club member and could go \"directly to the Presidents club desk to be given my keys\" as the pre-arrival email indicated. But, it too was unmanned. So I waited 5-10 minutes until a distracted gentleman wandered behind the desk as if he was looking for something. Feeling my gaze, he reluctantly said \"are you being helped\".. and my check in began.It should be noted that the room was ready and I was thanked for participating in the \"pre-check\" process that alerts them of my arrival. Great process.- The usually singly manned Concierge desk was quite the talk of my friends, although I did not personally use them. The comments were that they were abrupt, rude and completely unhelpful. Concierge are the ones that need to exude the highest level of service, even as all else fails.- The property has many different elevators in different sizes. On one day, 6 of us were together and squeezed into an elevator that allowed \"6\" according to the certificate. When our elevator stopped at another floor, a member of the Bell staff was waiting as the door opened. He proceeded to walk forward and basically squeeze himself in putting us over, but even more importantly, \"SQUEEZING ALL THE GUESTS?\" Great hotels today have trained their personnel to actually leave an elevator for the benefit of a guest.... here, their fundamentals are so flawed that they actually impose upon the guests.- Lastly, forget room service. One night, while entertaining, we ordered Chicken tenders, wings an French fries... we had some 20 people and as the night dragged and people began to adjourn, we waited and waited... finally, 2 hours and 15 minutes later, with only 5 people left, the door opened with 3 huge plates of chicken and two seemingly barrels of French fries. One of our people ordered and I'm not sure how they ordered, but this could have fed the whole floor.... So here I was with 500 worth of chicken and French fries and no one to share with.... I had to laugh in the morning when I woke and went to the parlor for coffee and had to maneuver around the piles of chicken and fries... On another occasion it took 4 hours and multiple phone calls to get a bottle of scotch sent up for one of our guests...Listen, I hate to be so harsh, but this property, Fairmont and most of all the guests deserve better. So, I figured it was a worthy opportunity to share so that perhaps this property could move to the type of experience worthy of the Brand and the Building.And in a place such as this, it is never without its bright lights. Jane from Food and Beverage and, while new to the job, was very accommodating and quite sweet. She took special care to make sure we were ok when she was on property. Tommy, has worked Bell Services for some 45 years or perhaps more. He is an institution and I was very happy to have met him shortly after arrival. Gracious host... unfortunately, I never got to see him again. Our bellman leaving was similarly pleasant and efficient.Also worthy of note is I had an opportunity to be in the Penthouse a few evenings with friends. It is one of the singularly most spectacular accommodations I have ever seen.I have written of how staff members in other Fairmonts have been of such high character that they have become friends and actually prompted us to return for that reason. On my last night, one of those people, Jason Lewis, the asst manager of the Rundle Lounge, gave me my best and only \"wow\" moment and he did it all the way from Banff, 1200 miles away.. A bottle of wine with a note in it compliments of Jason. He had remembered me mentioning my upcoming trip to San Francisco and wanted to make my experience special. Can you imagine putting that type of talent and the Fairmont culture into this property? 6 stars might be necessary. But as it is the clumbsy and uninspired overall service drags this property to 3 stars..."

This is a very quirky hotel.  The staff are fantastic from check in to cleaning.  I had free coffee machine with pods every day in my room at no cost.  I am a Travel Agent and I would definitely  stay here again.  The location is great.  It has brilliant pool area and most important the staff make it unique"

Well-l-l.... irons are on request and an affiliate fitness center is located a few blocks away.  They opened the new Mediterranean restaurant today and many items listed on the menu were not available.  Perhaps growing pains?  In all fairness, the doormen and the front desk agents were sincerely nice and very engaging.  They saved this review from being posted as a 1."

We chose this hotel after seeing it on TV and hearing about it during the election coverage and we wanted to go check or our and see it for ourselves. I cannot rave enough to tell you how happy we were with our stay at Trump Hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful and exquisitely decorated and the location could not be better for D.C. sightseeing, shopping, and dining. The rooms take first class accommodations to the next level- your name is on the TV to welcome you when you arrive, there are robes, slippers, a turn-down service with water and chocolate included. The bathroom and the closet are very spacious! The staff at Trump Hotel D.C. are all wonderfully welcoming, genuinely friendly and will treat you like royalty while you are staying there!! If you choose to stay anywhere else while you're in D.C., you might be saving money but you will be missing out on a wonderful world-class experience!"

        "review_text": "I found this hotel through research on here and other websites. We stayed 11 nights.It was totally worth the price.You won't get a better location in Waikiki, period.We arrived there couple of hours before the checkin started. Went through the paperwork with complimentary yummy fruit juices. Surprisingly upgraded to partial ocean view room, which made up for the 2hrs plus extra 30 minutes we had to wait for our room to be ready. Our room was a 2 double bed. It was perfect for our 3 piece family. Loved the blackout curtains, could sleep forever!In the evenings, having couple of drinks on the balcony listening to live music coming from the restaurant below while gazing into the ocean was great.The beach is literally at the back. You exit the hotel onto the beach 5 meters from the water's edge. We saw turtles everyday swimming around us!What makes the location amazing is that, not only being right at the beach, it is also right there where all the most popular restaurants / eateries are. It's also close to main bus stops that go to popular Honolulu spots.Beach + Pool + 3 hot tubs = Spoilt for choice.Staff are helpful but not in your face, which we liked very much.Our only disappointment was the around the island bus tour we were recommended / sold by the attractions desk that turned out to be a flop. Which we found it wasn't part of the hotel but Expedia. Even so, the hotel tried to make us happy and gave us a little discount as a gesture.I will definitely be back if I am ever in Honolulu.I didn't give 5 stars because of couple of details which aren't worth mentioning here."

Not close to Pike's Place Market, but close to the monorail which is a very affordable and easy to travel back and forth to downtown Seattle.   Room was very clean, very quiet.   My only complaint would be how disorganized the cruise shuttle service offered seemed to be.   You sign up for a time and are told to meet in the lobby, however, no one is checking off names and assigned times.  This turns it in to more of a \"free for all\" so to speak once the shuttle vans arrive.   My suggestion would be to just save the aggravation and take a taxi to the cruise piers."

        "review_text": "We stayed 4 nights at Coventry Inn and it was a wonderful experience. We were given a room facing Lombard Street on our first night and we found it too noisy. We called down the next morning and no problem, there was a room free facing Moulton Street (the back). Housekeeping cleaned it up while we went for breakfast, and it was all done when we got back. Great and prompt service!Pros:-Reasonably priced room rates.-Staff are friendly and helpful.-Rooms are clean. Large with sitting area. Beds comfy.-Free parking under the hotel.-Free wifi.-Location is awesome. We felt safe walking around in the evening.-Walk one/two blocks north to Chestnut Street and as you walk west, you\u2019ll find lots of restaurants and shops (including a Walgreens). Walk five short blocks south to Union Street, there are also lots of restaurants and little shops.-Public transit is convenient. We got a 3-day visitor passport which gives you unlimited rides on the MUNI buses, metro, historic streetcars, and cable cars. On Chestnut runs the #30 bus (for the closest stop, just walk up Buchanan). This bus gets you really close to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf and cable car. Get off near Hyde Street or just as the bus turns on Columbus Avenue. The Powell-Hyde cable car line takes you close to Chinatown and stops downtown at Powell near Market Street. If you want to go to the Golden Gate Bridge, walk to the corner of Chestnut and Laguna. Take the #28 19th Avenue bus (NOT the #28L). Drop off point has a beautiful view of the bridge and you can continue walking onto the bridge. Coming back, take the #28 Fort Mason (NOT Daly City).Cons:-Dated, old-fashioned decor. But really not a big deal as the rooms are clean and roomy.-Street noise in rooms facing Lombard Street is quite loud.-Rooms facing Moulton Street are quieter, but note there is garbage pick-up on one of the weekday mornings and it is loud.-Heating/AC unit is loud when it kicks in.-Wifi can get slow and spotty at times.Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons and we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay here again and recommend this hotel to friends and family."

And given that the extra charge for that room is negligible in context; don't stay here if you can't afford the upgrade or unless you don't need a view.The location is awesome; at the lower end of Waikiki you are within a few blocks of all the glitter yet across the road from peaceful parks, the zoo and aquarium. Staff are friendly. Rooms are well kept. Despite what I'm about to post; we rebooked here for our return to Waikiki after visiting the Big Island (and dumped our other hotel - luckily without charge).Things to watch out for;Be aware lower level rooms are noisy.All of the walls are definitely designed to transmit noise.Budget for the $23.00 per day surcharge for the 'free' internet and the room safe and access to the gym (wherever that is??!)."

        "review_text": "I am a Platinum Marriott Rewards member; there were some things I really liked about the hotel, and some things that I found very disappointing - especially considering my Marriott Rewards Platinum status.I purposely booked a rate that included valet parking because I know how expensive it is to park within the city limits of Washington DC.  There is nothing on the hotel's web site (under 'Hotel Details' or 'Maps & Transportation') which provide a limit on the height of the vehicle.  We drove my husband's Dodge Ram truck, which is 7 ft high (he has never had problems with ANY garage accepting his truck).  We were shocked when the valet pulled out a measuring stick (!) and told us the truck was too high to park in the garage.  They then pointed to an open parking lot across the street and told us we would have to park there ... at $24/day.  With no other choice, my husband parked his vehicle, while I went to check us in.I used the Marriott app to do check-in the day before my arrival; at 10 am the day of arrival I was notified (via the app) that my room was ready.  Due to bad traffic (welcome to N. Virginia), we didn't arrive until 4pm, although we were scheduled for a 3pm arrival.  Check-in at the mobile desk is normally very fast 1-2 minutes ... not here; took nearly 8 minutes and I was the only person checking in (i.e, there was no one in line ahead of me).  The desk clerk didn't seem to know what he was doing: he didn't know where my room keys were, he didn't thank me for being a Platinum member, he didn't offer me a choice of arrival gift offered to Platinum members; and when I inquired about getting a discount on the rate to compensate for paying for parking out my own pocket, he just shrugged his shoulders - emphasizing he really couldn't have cared less (NOT a great way to treat a Platinum member).  So check-in was a bust, just as parking was a bust.We were upgraded to a business suite; the room was huge.  We could have held a high school prom dance in the room, it was so large.  Typical comfortable Marriott bed.  Large flat screen TV that pulled out form the wall and swiveled so you could watch it from the seating area in the room, or from the bed.The bathroom was not so great. Why do hotels let men design bathrooms?!?  Not one single towel rack in the room, so the ONLY place to put your towels was on the floor.  The toilet is squeezed up again the shower stall, with 5 feet of open space between the other side of the toilet and sink/counter.  The shower had one of the stupid 'rain shower' heads - they are THE WORST; very low flow.  Again - why to hotels install such useless items?  You spend 3x longer in the shower trying to rinse the shampoo out of your hair, and soap off your body -- so where's the water savings?!?The neighborhood around the hotel was very nice. After spending 5 days in NYC the previous month, it is amazing to see just how clean the streets of DC are kept.  There is a large Metro stop 2 1/2 blocks from the hotel, and bus stop diagonally across the street (we hopped the bus (only $1!) and took it straight to Georgetown for dinner).  The DC Convention Center is across the street (north), and there is a nice group of restaurant on the other side of the hotel (south). A great location within the downtown DC area.Our rate included breakfast; wonderful selection, great omelettes to order, and a charming/happy waiter.Another big disappointment - their Club Lounge is closed on the weekends.  All Renaissance hotels in Europe (most of my business travel is here) open their lounges 7 days a week - why can't the US hotels do the same? This is my top complaint with Marriott, in general. Club access is a touted benefit for Gold and Platinum members, yet they are closed 2/7 of the time - not much of a benefit.So would I return to this hotel?  I'm not really sure.  The treatment I received as a Platinum Member was inexcusable.  For my loyalty to Marriott, I expect excellent service in return - so I'll be very interested to see if the hotel manager responds to this review, or to my survey (which I'm hoping the hotel will send me)."

        "review_text": "The hotel is second row hotels at Waikiki beach, located 5 minutes of waling for the beach front. And it is brand new, so rooms are fresh, clean, attractive and having very modern design. Some facing Pacific (you can see it between first line hotels) and some facing city/mountains view. As gold member I was up-graded from city to beach view at the higher floor, received vouchers for 1 drink per night at the pool bar (3rd floor basic facility) and breakfast in other hotel (Duke's) restaurant, as hotel's restaurant was not ready (summer 2016) yet.Breakfast was pretty generous with numerous hot dishes, omlette station, edd benedict offered, however the quality of food was not outstanding. Moreover the Duke's is very packed in the mornings, lots of famielies with unsupervised kids around.The other option was to use breakfast vouchers at Holoholo Caf\u00e9 and Market located by the reception, when one could get complimentary coffee/tea/drink and hot breakfast sandwich or burrito, or fruit, pastry, yoghurt parfait option.The main problem was the noise coming for a street heavy construction works, but it seems they are coming to the end. Otherwise very good, fresh, new option to stay at Waikiki area."

        "review_text": "My husband and I searched for months trying to decide on a hotel that would suit our needs.  We don't mind the crowds BUT we also didn't want to be in the thick of them either.  This was our second trip to Honolulu.  The first time, we rented a car and stayed in Kailua in a VRBO.  We quickly realized we are NOT VRBO people.  We like our privacy, amenities of a hotel, and the ability to walk everywhere to get our food, go to the beach, etc.  Having to drive everywhere in Oahu traffic was not something we wanted to experience again.  So this time, Park Shore Waikiki fit the bill.We stayed in late Feb-March 6.  Park Shore has THE BEST location for us.  Not only did our room on the 10th floor have partial ocean views but when we stepped out onto our deck, we were looking at the peaceful Kapiolani Park/Honolulu Zoo grounds.  We had treetop views which were stunning at all times of the day.  A HUGE shout out to Michelle who put us in our room.  We signed up for the Insider email before booking our room online which gave us 10% off the room rate.  Part of the perks of the Insider rate is an upgrade upon check in (which Michelle did for us) and a cute little vinyl type bag cooler with a couple granola bars and water bottles.  I think there were Hawaiian chips and cookies in there as well.  Our vacation was really starting on a high note!!We only encountered a few minor issues that may bother some people but didn't effect us much.1) The room doors slam loudly--we just held ours until it shut in consideration of others2) There is noise from the street but that's to be expected with 2 major roads out front.  The beach and park are right there so I just focused on those things3) They have coffee and juice in the lobby--coffee was not very good. The juice was refreshing after being at the beach, pool.  However, I found the ABC Store #66 that faced Waikiki Beach (basically it's located in the lobby level of the hotel) had the most delicious self service drip coffee all day long (they had a Signature Blend, Moana Dark and my ADDICTION all week long, Vanilla Macadamia).  For a large, it will set you back $1.46!!!!  Starbucks is also right outside the hotel but I was happy as a peach with my Vanilla Macadamia.4) No bathroom fans---self explanatory5) There was an \"industry night\" party during one of the days we were there.  Lulu's Waikiki was hosting it and it kept my husband up all night (3-4am).  Even with a noisemaker to drown out noise, it was incredibly loud for him.  I didn't know anything was happening so I guess it depends on if you're a light sleeper or not.We are already planning a trip back this January.  We won't go anywhere else.  We know what works for us and it is the Park Shore.  We encountered friendly staff and it's location to restaurants, beach, more restaurants, etc is second to none.  I also spent time in their pool, which is small, but it's on the 3rd floor level and with great views of the park and the beach so no complaints there. You also get a beach card upon check- in which allows you to check out towels and a small chair for the beach.  Just return them and you get a card back for the next day.  It was super convenient.  Can't wait to return!!!"

        "review_text": "While I loved my room at the Edgewater, and felt that the staff was first rate, I was completely shocked by the $50 per day parking fee ($41 + tax) that was added to my bill upon checkout.I felt violated, and I left with a very bad taste in my mouth. A fee of this magnitude should be brought to the forefront upon booking a room, and not hidden in the subtext. I understand that most hotels in downtown Seattle charge for parking, but this is beyond excessive.  I will most likely never stay at this hotel again."

        "review_text": "My Husband and I thought since the first time in history my job gave me 3 days off for Christmas why not go to Vegas. We had the best time ever. Even though it was cold and we got sick. It was pretty fun. We arrived at 6 pm on 12/24 and checked out on 12/27 at 8:30 am. The first room was way too big for us and they had double beds. Nice, but too much room. The front desk was awesome. It didn't take us long to check and they gave us another room, no problem. Our room was nice and cozy. The heaters were amazing. After going out for breakfast on Christmas day and my sinuses acting up, it was nice to sit in our room and just hang out. It was nice for the money. $133 for the whole stay. It was nice to be away from the strip, but be near the strip. The little kitchen area was nice. The microwave and fridge was cool to have. Plus it was not to far for other restaurants and stores to get things we needed.  Like I said, we had a great time and would plan to stay there again.  The parking lot is a bit small to get in and out. The bed was not comfy to me. I couldn't sleep on it at all. But we know it's an older Hotel that was revitalized. It's a little warn, but it gave us exactly what we needed."

The room was huge (including the bathroom) and was clean and quiet. The hotel bar was great (serving great bar \"snacks\"/meals). We went to a baseball game at Safeco field (thinking it was about 1 1/4 hour walk......which is what it told us when we googled)..only took us about 30mins and that was via China town. The staff were really helpful (especially when we inadvertently dialled 911.....a trap to watch our for, don't put in that extra 1). Would definitely recommend this hotel."

Firstly the service throughout the visit was second to none, they couldn't do enough for us the staff were great, but that's where the positives stopped for me. Breakfast was a disappointment, very little selection at the buffet although all well cooked, but very expensive for what it was. The rooms although perfectly clean were a bit of a let down, quite dark and boring if you ask me, which is fine if all the lines are clean cut but its just masking an old tired building, and it obvious throughout the property. From the outside the place is stunning unfortunately just not replicated on the inside. And lastly, paying for wifi?? in this day and age at a Ritz property when you're paying enough for a room as it is I think is terrible. We found the location good enough to explore the city from and had no trouble sleeping at all."

        "review_text": "We just stayed here for 10 days, never again. Our room was not cleaned during our stay and if you did want it cleaned it would cost $35 on top of the $15 per day resort fee for a light dusting and quick vacuum The pool area seemed nice on first impressions however if you did not get there before 8am to \"\" reserve \" your lounger with a towel etc then forget it. I thought that practice went with the Germans in the Costa Del Sol in the 80's but this is the USA 2017.  The pool deck area,  tables and loungers were covered in food and sticky drink left overs and it was clear that they were not cleaned at all. Parking was a nightmare,  even though my wife is disabled and we had the relevant car badge we could never find a disabled parking spot as it was always taken by non disabled vehicles and never policed by the hotel leaving us to walk long distances in 115 degree heat. Staff were unhelpful,  default answer was \" this is a time share resort \". On the day of leaving we requested a late checkout and we were told 12:00 midday that's it. 10:05 the maid let herself in. We explained. the late check out principle. Again she let herself in at 11:20 and 11:55.  Glad to be leaving......."

        "review_text": "It was difficult to decide on an overall rating for this hotel as it combined areas of excellence with 'room to improve'. We arrived early evening, straight from the airport; the valet service was excellent and remained so for the four days of our stay. A problem with my partner's credit card on arrival was smoothly and politely managed, and we were shown to our room, or what was effectively a small two floor apartment, with its own patio and hot tub. Downstairs there was a tiny kitchenette, lounge and restroom; upstairs (via a spiral staircase) a pleasantly appointed bedroom and ensuite. Slightly stunned and starving after a nine hour flight from Heathrow and the trauma of immigration and car hire, we sought out somewhere to grab a burger before bed, but the chap we asked was, though willing, not very helpful. Undeterred, we struck out across Washington Avenue only to be stopped by a torrential tropical downpour! We sheltered in a shop doorway--the shopkeeper very kindly asked us to enter the shop if we were getting wet--until the rain eased, but after a further 15 minutes gave up our search and returned to the hotel to seek sustenance. We ordered burgers, only to be told that the kitchen had run out of meat to make them with; a request for the fish on the menu was similarly unsuccessful--they had run out...we settled for fried shrimp (him) and calamari (me); perfectly acceptable but not what we had hoped for, which kind of set the pattern for the remainder of our stay.We stayed for four nights; each evening the hotel offered complimentary wine and nibbles (red wine good, white wine almost undrinkable, nibbles good) and we enjoyed sitting in the small gardens near the small swimming pool--usually occupied by children. We tried out our hot tub, slightly anxious about the thin screen of bamboo that only partially concealed us from the main road and passers-by on the pavement. While the tub was hot and the bubbles all we might have hoped for, the bath salts provided had mostly dissolved in the tropical downpour of the night before and the loungers and towels were respectively damp/wet as the towels had not been replaced after the rain. Making the most of the sun after our hot tub was a mistake as the humid damp conditions and the greenery made the patio a breeding ground for mosquitos...we stocked up on insect repellents and bite cream the following day and sported our unsightly red, swollen and highly irritating bites for the first week of our holiday. The experience meant that we didn't subsequently use the patio at all. The accommodation was spotless and well-tended, although bed making/room refreshing was done late in the day and outside towels caught in subsequent rainstorms were not replaced, nor was the hot tub cleaned of twigs etc.; the hotel lounge/restaurant area/lobby needed redoing/freshening up....However, the staff were polite and friendly; the manageress recommended some very good restaurants, the people serving the evening drinks and nibbles were cheerful and helpful, a request for milk to put in our morning coffee/tea (made in our room using our own kettle although complimentary beverages were available in the lounge in the mornings) was promptly satisfied with a small jug of fresh milk at no extra charge; struggles with the telephone system when sorting out the credit card issue were resolved with the help of the reception staff--as was the credit card issue; a warning to others--if upgrading your choice of vehicle at the car hire centre make sure you check how much extra it is going to cost!--so overall a pleasant stay at the Angler's and would have rated it as 'good' had that been an option."

        "review_text": "I am a fan of the Kimpton Hotel Group and have stayed at other Kimptons in SF and across the U.S. I wanted to give the Argonaut a try since the rooms looked visually appealing and the reviews were on par with my experiences at other Kimptons. Overall, I would actually say that our stay was disappointing for several reasons, most on the part of the Argonaut, the rest on myself.Disappointing aspects (in no specific order):The Staff - I felt it was rather non-existent, aside from the gentlemen working the front door. Check-in was fine, but not overly welcoming, this was unusual for a Kimpton. Check-out, well, even though we stood in line we waited longer since a person just sauntered up to ask questions and the the guest relations representative allowed this to happen. My usually experience at a Kimpton is you are often greeted warmly throughout your stay, and there is a large staff presence in the hotel. Any other Kimpton I have stayed at I would constantly see and be greeted by staff members at all hours of the day -This was not the case here.The wine hour - was packed and seemed to be filled with people who knew about it, but were actually not staying at the hotel. In fact I often saw people walking away from the hotel with wine glasses. This seems like a real liability issue. I am not even sure there are people managing the wine hour.There was no complimentary or tea or coffee service as you would find at other Kimptons in the morning. Sure, there was a coffee maker in the room, but  in the bathroom and that was uncomfortable at best. They probably didn't want to deal with another round of people coming in for the free items - logical, but not really a Kimpton experience.The rooms - the rooms are visually appealing and spacious, but the beds were so hard that we barely slept. In hindsight, we wish we would have check out and tried another hotel because all of us (3 stayed in one room) found we were in pain a week after traveling. This is something another guest noted. The beds in the double rooms are way too hard. I actually prefer a firmer bed, but these beds were so hard that one of us actually decided to try sleeping in the arm chair in the room - they were that uncomfortable. I can't convey how much this impacted our stay and the days after our stay. I really felt awful and I am very sorry that I didn't saying anything about it at the time because I paid financially, physically, and mentally for it.Cleanliness - the room was mostly clean, but there were a lot of inconsistencies in the cleaning from day one, to day two, and three. I also found it frustrating that the carpets were not vacuumed daily - this seems like basic room service to me. I felt there was a disconnect in this area that could be easily managed. We left tips daily, which were taken but the items we specifically requested - more towels, floor vacuumed were not provided.The restaurant  is terrible. Don't go! There are much better places to eat in SF and I highly recommend that you by bypass it at all cost. Our breakfast was terrible! The service was careless and lackadaisical, our server actually told us he spaced out while taking our order. The food was served cold, without any condiments, and it was EXPENSIVE for what you get. Skip it!The location - this is my fault. I wanted to try something different and get out of downtown but I felt this location was too much on the fringe of everything. Sure it was within walking distance to many things, but they were not things I am that interested in. If you want to stay on the Wharf, note that this is on the fringe of it, not the heart of it. If you don't want to be in a touristy location with the Ding, Ding, Ding of the trolley nearby and the hoots and shouts of the duck boats then stay away from this location at all costs - it will make you mad. While not a big deal the hotel is also fully of families - at all hours children were running up and down the halls. There are also only two elevators and you often had to wait (a short wait, not a big deal)  to get to your room at all hours.After thinking about it after the fact, I would stay this stay was rather poor. If I had to do it all over again I would really consider bringing it up the the management, but I checked in on Christmas day and I heard them tell someone inquiring about a room that they only had two left. I knew it would be fruitless to complain about the beds when there was clearly no comparable room we could be moved to.When we left the doorman asked us how our stay was and we mentioned the how terrible the beds were and his response was, \"Everyone says that! It's been a real problem and management is looking into it.\" This actually made everything worse. Really? You know this is a problem but you're just \"looking into it?!\" The really frustrating aspect is that it's very hard to find many rooms in the SF area with two queen beds, most of the rooms offer only two full beds - while this is find for two people it's challenging for three adults. This was the main reason we selected this hotel because it was important for all of us to be together, in the same room, during the holidays.I wouldn't stay again, and I would suggest others look elsewhere when in the area. There are many great hotels in SF. It's perhaps one of the most competitive hotel markets in any city I've traveled to and in - don't sell yourself short - make sure you select a hotel that really fits what you are looking for in regards to location, comfort, cleanliness, friendliness, price, and room parameters. It's possible that this hotel will meet your needs, but don't be fooled by all of the positive praise it has received, it was just okay."

The entire hotel staff was on strike, as hotel management does not pay them live-able wages.  Trash and dirty towels were dumped in the hallways.  In addition, there was constant noise outside, which could be heard in our room on the 11th floor, from the striking employees (whistles, horns, drums, etc).  Room service was non-existent.  Could not get anyone on the phone when I dialed the service number.  And the hotel management had the gall to actually charge me for the hotel stay.  It's supposedly a luxury hotel, but had the service of a Motel 6!"

Housekeeping is done once weekly. The pool is full of screaming, snotty nosed brats and their horrible parents who think it's fine to have their babies paddle around in dirty diapers. We were told room service is available, then no, then maybe, and finally that room service consists of someone running your order up to the room from the terrible deli near the main pool.Worst of all, Management thinks it's just fine to hold very, very loud functions directly outside your windows until 10 pm. ( and the noise after that when everything is taken down and carted away) without any mention that you might be inconvenienced by the ear splitting bad, bad bar band. They do not care about you, the paying guest. Some staff are really rude, ie the doorman didn't thank me for the 3 bucks I gave him just to open the taxi door for me. He just slammed the door and walked away. Wish we could have done same.I wouldn't dream of buying a timeshare at this dump."

        "review_text": "This boutique hotel is located in the San Francisco National Maritime Historical Park @ Fisherman's Wharf, owned by the National Park Service.  The hotel was originally the Haslett Warehouse, part of the fruit & vegetable cannery complex, once known as the California Fruit Association, which later became known as Del Monte.  The construction of the building used solid early 20th century bricks & Douglas fir wooden structural support beams for the foundation & aesthetic frame.  It is breathtakingly beautiful from the moment you walk into the nautically re-created artifacts (some of which are authentic artifacts) to the first look of your accommodation.  The interior decor is attractive & almost seductive to the senses so as to induce a relaxation of the usual defenses of walking into a large city hotel. The greeting staff are professional & warm in their welcoming decorum.  The suite rooms are stunning: spacious, arranged for real usage, & aesthetically pleasing. The amenities in the room are superb, right down to the individualized accordion wall mirror in the bathroom, allowing grooming within a one inch view compared to the usual extended distance from the sink-mirror arrangement.  The windows in the rooms actually function on a type of cam pivot design that relies on a rolling handle to open & close the two adjoining window panes.  This is an old fashioned design that is fun to operate & very safe since the framed glass panels will stop opening @ about a 45 degree angle.  Plenty of fresh cool air in the morning, making a wake up call a very pleasant sensation! San Francisco has the most expensive hotel rates in the nation, but one visit to the Argonaut Hotel will resolve any doubts that a visitor may have about the reason for the high costs: you really do get what you pay for @ the Argonaut!"

        "review_text": "I booked online at Booking.com, and immediately after realized I didn't actually need the room, as friends were able to put us up. I called right away and asked if they could please make an exception to their online booking no-cancellation policy, as I had made a mistake. The desk receptionist said I would have to wait for the manager, who wouldn't be back until the next day. The manager was adamant that she would not make an exception, insisting that I could only change the date and not cancel. I explained that I wouldn't need the room on any other date because we were moving to the area. She said that was all she was willing to do, as there was a no cancellation policy. No cancellation policies exist so there won't be last-minute cancellations where you can't fill the room - I called immediately, so this is just her insisting on keeping the $300 for a booking I couldn't even keep. So we kept the room, even though we didn't need it, and since we were both laid up with the flu, we stayed with our friends instead of checking into the hotel that night. I just checked my credit card statement and there's an inexplicable $8.00 charge from this hotel. For what? Why? Why would they do that? It's not the amount of money that matters but they already HAD $300 I could ill afford and now they charge me $8 for no reason at all? We weren't even THERE, what could we possibly have done to merit a charge? I called to ask what the charge was for and the receptionist said he didn't know, he'd have to ask the manager. OH GOOD can't wait to deal with that penny-pinching jerk again, can't wait to hear why she charged me $8 in addition to the $300 I paid for a room she probably went ahead and rented to someone else so she could double her money. Their hold music, by the way, promises a \"friendly and accommodating\" staff. They've been anything but friendly and accommodating. They've been useless without this manager and the manager has been a straight-up epithet. I don't know what the rooms are like and I don't care - the management is a piece of work."

        "review_text": "My husband and I recently returned from a 10 night stay in the US travelling from the UK. This was a special trip booked by myself as a gift for my husbands 40th birthday. We have 2 small children who were left at home with family so I wanted to push the boat out. We started our trip in New York and stayed at a cheaper (still expensive) hotel for the first 7 nights where the service was outstanding. Upon arrival, the staff on the front desk wished my husband a happy birthday, there was a card waiting for him in our room and every member of staff made an effort to speak to us every day and knew our names. We felt really at home and welcome. Unfortunately, our experience at the Jefferson was nowhere near as good. We were expecting great things due to the reviews on Tripadvisor and the amount I had paid. The first disappointment was upon check in where the lady on reception made no effort to engage us in any kind of conversation, didn't mention anything about it being my husbands birthday (I had passed this information on when I booked) and our room wasn't ready even though we checked in after 3pm. After waiting for 45 minutes and not hearing anything, I went to reception and asked them if we could go and wait in the bar and have a complimentary drink. Surely this isn't something a guest should have to suggest to a 5 star hotel?!?! We were told that was fine and another guest who was also waiting for his room ended up doing the same thing. He told me he travels to Washington a lot with business and would never go back to the Jefferson. It was his first time staying at the hotel and the check in experience and lack of room being ready was enough for him never to go back. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, but the service massively lets it down. My 3 star review is purely for the building. I was given no information upon check in and found out after we'd left that butler service is available. That would have been great to know when we'd actually been there. I found out from the internet that a complimentary car is available at certain hours of the day. When we came to reception we were always asked if we'd like them to book us a taxi. When I asked if the car was available it always was so why was this not offered?!?! I think they were saving it for couples they deemed more worthy or business travelers? Maybe because we were on holiday and dressed casually they felt we shouldn't be travelling in their luxury vehicle? That's how it felt anyway. Also, there are complimentary bottles of water located at the entrance of the hotel which we found ourselves and had to ask for each time we passed. We were never offered a bottle once during our 3 day stay and the temperatures were insainly hot. Lastly, the service in the bar was very hit and miss. Sometimes you'd get given a glass of water and some nibbles with your drinks, sometimes you wouldn't. Sometimes you'd end up having to go to the bar yourself because you were ignored, sometimes a bar tender would come over to your table straight away. I was very disappointed as we were checking out when my husband said he hadn't enjoyed his stay at the hotel. We would never stay at the Jefferson again."

        "review_text": "We have a long history of staying at The Royal Hawaiian.  The \"Pink Princess\" is a beautiful oasis in the now taller skyline of Waikiki; a bit of a throwback, but a lovely one among the oldest remaining stand of palms; you walk thru the Royal Hawaiian Center upscale shops, or past the towering Sheraton Waikiki, and suddenly you breath in and relax almost automatically when you feel the beautifully landscaped place.  We like the Maialani Tower with its great views of Diamond Head and the ocean. The rooms aren't huge, but very functional, with small bar area, and great lanai overlooking the beach and water.  A nice buffet included at breakfast, espresso machine that runs all hours, and a wine and beer happy hour each night.  You can reserve beach chairs either from the Waikiki Beach Boys at the hotel, or in general from them.  That's the way to go for a beach day.  Nice shops between the RH signature store, Newt's with their nice Hawaiian shirts and hats; Accent, and Tori Richard.  Great beach bar:  Mai Tai.  Azure Restaurant.  Nice bake shop with the classic pink cake.  Right in the heart of Waikiki and all its great shopping and food options.  And if you like to swim, it has the BEST beach of any of the Waikiki hotels with really nice ocean swimming without a lot of current and a sandbar off shore that protects things.  Great atmosphere in the public areas with it's classic Hawaiian themes, complete with the famous Edward Savage \"Lurline\" paintings of romanticized Hawaiian culture; flowers everywhere, and we were very happy to see the beautiful sculpted pink inset carpet restored this year to its original glory on the covered hall that leads on one side of the open courtyard from the main hotel to the Mailani Tower and beach/pool.  Beautiful!  There are a couple of fancier places we have stayed in, but now we always return to the Royal for its \"real\" Hawaiian charm, and at reasonable prices for a top notch resort.  Excellent staff at all levels."

Pineapple theme going on in the decor, pineapple water and yes, afternoon cupcakes.  The one \"badness\" was the abandoned graffiti covered scary \"tenement\" outside the windows.  I opened the curtains and closed them.  We were not hanging out in the room much but ask for a room with a different view if available.  I understand this is a temporary problem, but yikes.

        "review_text": "I'm stilling staying at this hotel and I can't wait to write a review.  I had high expectations due to the high reviews everywhere, it's #2 of honolulu after the Trump, really??First of all, we got lost finding the entrance of this place, as it claim to be a 4.5 star hoteI, I was looking for a bright big entrance with signs, there wasn't, we arrived late at night and the entrance was very dark, with no obvious signs outside, only a tiny 40cm x 40cm sign on the wall close to the entrance door, we circled the building twice and didn't know it was the front entrance.  When I walk in I had to ask if it's the Modern, because it really doesn't look like it.The front desk girl I could only give her 3 star, don't get me wrong, she's not rude or anything, just careless, for a 4.5 star hotel.  So we arrived after 1am due to flight delay, the front desk girl was playing with her cell phone when I walked in, there was no greeting when she saw me, no small talks at all, just quietly proceed with check in.  And when she saw my car in the driveway she said \" oh, you're gonna park with us?\"  Well, she sounds surprised, but it was our first time here and we didn't know anywhere else to park, so I asked, is there any alternatives?   She looked at the computers and without looking at me, she said \"across the street maybe\", it was almost 2am in the morning, we're too tired to check it out so I asked if she knew how much across the street charge, she said \"I don't know\" and continued with her check-in.  So we figured parking here probably all expensive and we just parked at the hotel for$28/day.  But next morning when we walk out, at the hotel entrance we can see the parkade across the street had a big sign, $20/day...   And the next day when we walked to the back of the hotel, there were meter parkings for $12/day.  I've been to many hotels, from 3 star to 5 star, or time share, all front desk staffs were extremely helpful, they will let you know what's around and some even draw out maps of where the parking is cheaper.  The Modern is not a cheap hotel, I would expect them to be more helpful rather than trick you to park at their ridiculous expensive parking.And the rooms, they're nicely decorated, but no bathtub, shower only.  The rooms at lower floors are extremely noisy, from the street and the bar downstairs, their windows are not soundproof.  We had a 3rd floor room then we changed to 6th floor, still very noisy but better.  Last night there were drunk guys from the bar yelling around 3am to 4am, we couldn't sleep till they finish.Other staffs are friendly and helpful, but I do expect that with this kind of hotel.  Location is good, free wifi is fast.Overall nothing stands out.  For almost $400/night, I would choose somewhere else next time."

Beds are comfortable, rooms are clean and valet staff are lovely.The cost of the room was substantial considering that the extra cost for an \"ocean view\" meant that if you went on the the balcony and looked on an angle you could see a portion of the beach directly in front of the hotel. What I really did not like is that the balconies of the neighboring hotel faced ours and were so close that I could see inside their rooms clearly which meant they could also see into mine. To avoid this I had the curtains drawn.Would not recommend an ocean view room at this property."

        "review_text": "It's no secret that Dubai has some of the most amazing architecture in the world, and that a fair amount of that architecture is filled with some of the best hotels in the world. While a number of them border on the absurd (ahem, Burj Al Arab) in terms of both price and amenities -- and others simply aren't worth the hype (hello, Armani Hotel!) -- the Park Hyatt has one feature seen at virtually none of the others in its league: peace and quiet. If you've been to Dubai, you undoubtedly already know what a luxury this is, given the city's hypergrowth and often-maddening traffic and crowds. (It is, after all, home to a single mall that receives more annual visitors than the ENTIRE CITY OF NEW YORK. Think about that for a sec.) If you haven't been there yet ... well, you'll just have to trust me on this one!The Park Hyatt is surprisingly close to Dubai's airport (although noise from it is nonexistent), though what should have been a ten-minute trip there in my rental car turned into more like 60, thanks to the Byzantine roads that characterize the oldest parts of the city. (Two pro tips: buy a local SIM card for your phone *immediately* upon entering the DXB arrivals hall, and DO NOT rent a car unless absolutely necessary. Uber offers service there and is both cheaper and vastly easier than trying to navigate the city yourself.) After a minor eternity, I finally found the place. Driving onto the property is slightly surreal, given that it's surrounded by a golf course and the surrounding area is almost completely invisible. Believe it or not, it reminded me more than anything else of driving in to a Hawaiian resort hotel!VERY unusually for Dubai, the hotel is both low-rise and designed in a manner perhaps best described as \"contemporary Moorish,\" as opposed to the \"cutting-edge contemporary\" seen in many of the city's skyscrapers. Despite my early arrival at around 9am -- and also despite the fact that my hotel confirmation explicitly stated that early arrivals would be subject to an additional day's fee -- I was not only *not* charged extra, but also automatically upgraded to a larger room with a patio and view of the adjacent marina. (Note that I do not have any special \"privileges\" with Hyatt in general.)As for the room itself: ye gods!! I'm no stranger to either five-star hotel rooms or to Park Hyatts, but this one is one of *the* nicest I've seen to date. The bathroom area was simply *stunning*, with a free-standing Duravit-style tub in the middle and a sizable closet area. The room's furnishings were exceptionally plush even by five-star standards, and the bed was so absurdly comfortable that I almost immediately fell asleep for a four-hour nap! (Note that I had already slept a full eight hours on the flight over.)During the regrettably short two-day duration of my time there, I appreciated nearly every aspect of the facility. Although the property apparently had two corporate retreats happening at the time, I never encountered anything remotely close to a crowd, thanks to the hotel's exceptionally spacious layout -- broken up by numerous very nice garden areas and non-linear buildings. I definitely appreciated the free (and speedy) Internet access as well as the complimentary breakfasts, which included a *huge* buffet featuring Western, Eastern *and* various types of regional cuisines.(Side note: Dubai is rather unusual in terms of brunch, which is most definitely a \"thing\" and found at every high-end hotel in the city. The unusual part is twofold: brunch always occurs on Fridays, due in part to the city's Sunday-Thursday work week, and the brunches are by a *gargantuan* margin the most lavish I've seen anywhere in the world -- and, having been to 50-odd countries, I've seen a lot. While I didn't partake in it, I know from local friends that the Park Hyatt's brunch is considered to be the best in Dubai -- as well as the most expensive. The priciest variant, which I believe includes unlimited vintage Champagne, costs -- brace yourself -- around US$250. My stay at the hotel happened to include a Friday, however, and when I walked by the restaurant hosting the hotel's brunch it sounded like they had a full house. Also, while the city's \"clubbing season\" had just concluded by the time I arrived, the hotel is within easy walking distance of what I hear are great clubbing options amidst its \"old\" marina in Dubai's Deira area.)Finally, one of the best parts was the price. I managed to land a last-minute rate that was low enough to hit the point of absurdity, even considering the fact that I was visiting during the \"shoulder season\" between Dubai's October-April peak and its June-August heat-and-humidity hell. I feel ashamed even *stating* it -- I would have gladly paid more to stay there! -- but let's just say it was THE best deal I've encountered, excepting Priceline bookings, since staying in the Peninsula Bangkok for around $100 during the post-9/11 travel lull.My *only* quibble with the place isn't one that bugged me personally, but might be problematic for others. Unlike nearly every other high-end hotel in Dubai, the Park Hyatt is located in the \"older\" section of the city (\"older\" being a relative term, of course). While it's extremely convenient in terms of airport access, it's a fair bit away from the several areas that one could describe as Dubai's \"city centres.\" Dubai's ex-pat community has in large part migrated to the Dubai Marina area, near the entrance to the city's infamous Palm Jumeirah. Even without traffic, it's nearly a half-hour drive there from the Park Hyatt, and it takes 15-20 minutes to drive to the Burj Khalifa complex. Again, though, your best bet for transportation is Uber, and presumably due to the emirate's ridiculously inexpensive petrol, local Uber prices are among the lowest I've seen anywhere in the world. (Taxis are also plentiful, but I think Uber's easier logistically speaking given that you can enter your destination address on your phone prior to pickup.)In sum: in a city filled with world-class hotels, the Park Hyatt sits near the top, and arguably above ALL lists in terms of nightly rates, even if you don't snag the kind of mega-bargain I had."

Aside from that, the hotel is centrally located- Powell St Bart is just steps away and taxis are always available outside- a blessing in San Francisco. It's walkable to Financial District and SoMa if you're here for a business trip. The one downside of this hotel was that the room service menu wasn't too extensive."

The location is good although well away from the centre for shops/restaurants and nightlife -a good 20-30minute walk however the beach and marina are right in front which was great.   On arrival we were given a room with no balcony, when queried we were told 'no double rooms have balconies' and the only solution was to upgrade to a suite.   We had booked for our 2 children to be with us in the room yet breakfast was only included for 2 - essentially kids had to eat elsewhere or we had to pay $47 dollars per head for their breakfast (which included one orange juice or one coffee - not both!) so we spent our holiday with 4 of us in a cramped room and each morning my husband taking my youngest outside for breakfast whilst my oldest child ate with me - not at all the fantastic family holiday we planned.   Staff were unfriendly and not at all interested in making your stay memorable for the right reasons, the pool area is beautiful and beds were fairly easy to reserve in the morning however if you leave your bed for more than 30mins they remove your towels and give your beds away - on one occasion I told the poolboy we were going for a bite to eat and would be back within the hour and on our return he had given away our beds - even although others were available or had been left for longer, it was as though he wanted to make a point and no apology or explanation was offered.   The cocktails and pool bar staff are the one exception, they were lovely.   The lounge and live music downstairs lacked any ambience or atmosphere and on the Saturday night there is a nightclub in the hotel that goes on until the early hours with music blaring through the rooms upstairs, fine if that's what you expect but no mention of this was made anywhere when booking.   This hotel was way over priced for what you get and I have stayed in much more customer focused and luxurious hotels for much less, we will never be back and were glad to be leaving after 5 days.   awful, just awful."

        "review_text": "When I checked in, I asked for a nice, quiet room. I was impressed by the room. It was a nice, decent size and looked recently renovated. I also love, love, loved the champagne breakfast buffet. I had a few wonderful mimosas, and the breakfast food was great. If you have the Silver Sevens Players Club card, it is only $10. Without the card, I paid $14. It was still wonderful.There were a few negatives. I had a really drunk woman screaming and swearing that checked into the room next to me at 4:30 am. She was screaming and woke me up. I yelled nicely asking her to please be quiet because I was trying to sleep. She didn't stop. I then pounded on the walls. She then stormed out of her room trying to see who was politely yelling. I then went out of my room and said \"Yes, I am trying to sleep. Can you please be quiet?\" She finally quieted down.Since the rooms are inexpensive, you do get a real mix of people staying at the hotel. I was also awakened a few other times by people yelling down the halls.The room had a little refrigerator, which I appreciated. The ice machines are hard to locate. They are, I am told, on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors. I finally found one on the 1st floor. You may have to ask. It was hard to find.I had a really nice, drunk guy who had just won big hit on me and tell me I was beautiful. I declined the offer of a shot. He politely walked away. That was the only time I was hit on in Vegas, and it did make my day.Would I stay here again? I'm not sure. I only booked this for one night, and then I moved to the Tuscany, which I love. It's only about 1/2 mile walk. The loud, drunk neighbors might keep me away from Silver Sevens. To be fair, it was a Saturday night, which can be louder and more crazy. However, I would definitely stop in for the champagne Saturday or Sunday breakfast buffet. The slots were fun also."

        "review_text": "We came to Seattle to shop downtown for bridal accessories and mother of bride dresses. We did not want to pay the $50 US parking fees at the downtown  hotels so was recommended to stay at the Hampton Inn. What a perfect place! So friendly and the room, which was a two bedroom suite with a kitchen, was very clean and spacious. The monorail is only a short walk away to the Space Needle and for $2.50 you are downtown, directly outside of Nordstrom, in less than 10 minutes. One stop shopping! After a long day we picked up some groceries at the store a block away and made dinner of appts and wine inthe room. Excellent complimentary full breakfast the next morning. Woulddefinitely recommend to anyone wishing to avoid the higher downtown hotel rates."

        "review_text": "First of all this is not a resort but a hotel instead.  We arrived with our 2 boys last week.  We were not greeted with leis, I had to ask Roger( i believe that was his name)  at the front desk when checking in if the leis are only for certain people and were then given one each.  What a first impression!!!!  We were excited to go to our Historic garden view room, pull the curtains and what did we see....a huge concrete wall and if you stretch really hard you can see a part of the garden.  I called and Jaime was able to get us another room on a floor below with an ocean view.Pros:  The hotel is very beautiful, the surrounding is beautiful and clean.Staff outside by bell man were very courteous and helpful and always pleasantCons:  Always had to call for coffee in the roomConcierge is always too busyGuys/gals by the pool are extremely rude.  One guy with an attitude told me to come down at 7am to get a pool chair...really?  One of them told my husband to write his name clearly on the rental slip for a boogie board.  Hello...why don't you write so you can understand, if that's your job.I was disappointed that I couldn't take a mai tai on the beach, I was told the state prohibits it.  I couldn't even take food on the beach.  On a positive, the beach was clean and well behave people.Who spends thousands of dollars for a vacation and still have to spend $40 a day to rent an umbrella and chairs....what a rip off.There was a leak in the bathroom, maintenance came and fixed up while we went to dinner.  Came back only to find that all over the sink and my makeup and toiletries were covered in black dusk.  I have pictures to prove all of this but out of respect for the hotel I will not post.   I called the front desk and they waived the resort fees and some of the rental charges.  And oh, at 11pm when we were all fast asleep, housecleaning was knocking on our door, seriously?The restaurants are very pricey, we eat a lot at Duke's at the Outrigger and at the Sheraton.Overall, Hawaii is beautiful.  We rented a car and drove all over and loved it.  As for the hotel, I was disappointed the way we were treated and for that reason I will not return to this hotel."

        "review_text": "Ok, so we are gradually working our way around Chicago to visit all of the AMEX FHR plan hotels to try them out, since we travel to the city several times a year. Variety is the spice of life, so they say. This trip, we were fortunate enough to stay at Mr. Trump's hotel, and it was a fabulous, if \"Trumpian\" experience.First, the superlatives: the upgraded room we were assigned was FABULOUS! Full living room and bedroom with fireplace, massive flat screen TVs, full kitchen, Sub-zero, Miele dishwasher... We were tempted to not leave the room at all and literally wallow in the beautiful, luxurious apartment-like surroundings, rather than hitting the spots in a gritty town we have grown to love. The housekeeping was immaculate. Turndown service superb. And, unlike some other high end hotels in Chicago, there was a diversity of American dialect, appearance, and mannerism amongst hotel staff-- which personally, I prefer. This is Chicago, a socioeconomic, and cultural hodgepodge. I do understand that uniformity can be part of a hotel's brand, but IMO that reflects the ethos of Disneyland, not America.The not so superlative: pricey room service, the presentation and seasoning of the food was not reflective of the premium prices charged, though the service itself was warm and considerate. Minibar prices were stratospheric: $220 for a bottle of Veuve, $110 for a bottle of Mediocre Pinot. This just seemed a bit grabby to me, since we all know what those items go for at Bevmo...The humorous:  Trump-branded EVERYTHING. I suspect that part of a high-end experience for some may include the feeling that one is at a property where a sense of discretion and subtlety is an integral part of the experience. There was no such sense at The Trump. The customer would never be in any doubt at to whose hotel this was. Trump-branded soaps, lotions, mouthwash, candy, trash can liners (), etc. Every time you turned around you were bumping into all things Trump. This gave us a chuckle. But it was also telling...Would we return to this property again? Absolutely. This represented an overall good value for price paid, but beware the minibar."

It just looks like any other good hotel. There is no adults only executive area anymore, or dedicated check in. Upstairs is all cordoned off and very few restaurants are available. Even the sun beds are of a poorer quality. The breakfast selection is great and the staff at this hotel are still excellent."

The hotel was perfect.  It is around the corner from the red line, which takes you directly to both stadiums.  the downtown location is also perfect for sightseeing - five minute walk to the Art Institute of Chicago, where we spent several hours.  It is walking distance to tons of attractions, including the wonderful architecture boat tour the hotel recommended.The room (double suite) was very nicely appointed with wonderful linens and an amazing bathroom.  The staff at the hotel is super courteous and helpful.  We ate breakfast at the hotel which was good and had late night snacks and drinks in the lounge which were outstanding."

I was a little surprised that on Saturday there was only one Valet, so he was pretty busy. Despite that, he was able to be sure I got a service I needed before 4pm.

        "review_text": "My husband won a week trip to Hawaii, they put us up at this hotel. It's not the greatest hotel but it's not the worst either, especially for the location. The only reason I gave it four stars was not necessarily for the hotel itself, which could use a bit of updating. However they were renovating one of the elevators during our stay (the other was already completed) so one elevator for 15 floors and thousands of guests wasn't ideal. The room itself was a pretty decent size, we stayed in the superior room with the Lanai (balcony), it has a king bed and a sofa that has a pull out bed. It includes a refrigerator (kept things from spoiling but didn't keep things extremely cold), a microwave, coffee pot with coffee, plates, mugs and silverware. They had a small TV and a PS3 in the room where you could watch movies from the DVD rental box downstairs. Anyway, the four stars, you're two blocks from Waikiki beach. About a 15 minute walk from the zoo and aquarium and various shops/mall. Down the street from the hotel there is also a food pantry (grocery store) that also has a coffee bean and a delicious food place called Hi Steaks. There's an ABC store that is extremely handy (even though they have one on just about every corner).The hotel offers breakfast from 7-9 am. Which consists of pancakes, ham, white rice (soy sauce available), oranges, apples, two or three different types of cakes and donuts, and cereal (with powdered milk). They have tea, orange juice and coffee for drinks.The staff was nice even though upon arrival we had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to check us in even though there were three people behind the main desk. the six nights we were there, house keeping only serviced our room twice. Both days we were out most of the day until late evening. The other days it would be 2:30 or 3pm when we would get back and they would be cleaning the rooms next door, but not ours. We understood with 15 floors and thousands of rooms maybe one or two days but four days? At least when they knocked, they were friendly and asked if we needed anything.There is a laundry room in the parking garage/basement under the hotel. $1.25 for washer and another $1.25 for dryer, it honestly came in handy. The wifi was okay but not great, it got the job done.Overall our stay was pretty good and we would stay here again."

A majority of the hotels in Honolulu are extremely dated, but they have kept Moana Surfrider in amazing condition. Our room was a fantastic size. Beds were comfy, and balconies were a good size too. Bathrooms were good, except shower pressure was pretty abysmal. Service was friendly and fast. Great bar to view the sunset - Entertainment was hit & miss. Location was unbelievable, right near everything we needed. We were going to book at the Hilton Hawaiian Village but are so happy we didn't, because the Hilton was in such a bad location. Upon checking out, there were many charges added to the bill which we were not notified of on our confirmation or arrival. As an example to have interconnecting rooms we had a charge of $25 per room per day! This was really disappointing and an example of three of four other charges on top which put on an extra $150 charge per day to what we thought we were paying. Please be aware of this before booking with them as I can't imagine how many people would be shocked at this too! Other than that, we had a pleasant stay and would recommend to others..."

Upon arrival we were upgraded to an executive room on the 36th floor with city view and were in awe watching the sunrise from the balcony. The executive lounge is in the basement and the food was varied and abundant with convenient brekkie times and light dinner options. The water cooler next to the front desk was an extra added perk to quench the Hawaiian thirst. The location of the hotel is blocks away from Waikiki beach and Waikiki itself has a myriad of global retailers and trending restaurants to choose from. Also, we managed to get by using Uber and public buses since parking is at a premium in Waikiki. The only tip is to have exact change before hopping on the bus (US$ 2.50) per journey."

        "review_text": "This is my third visit to this grand old lady, but unfortunately not the best. I did as usual book through Starwood because of the points but I'll never do that again. To cut a long story short, no service, automated messages and a three seperate sets of email conversations to no avail,  I was forced to call the hotel directly from Australia to try and confirm final dates and changes to booking. All I can say on that matter is try and book directly with the hotel not through Starwood even if you are an overseas guest.)Once I arrived, I was kindly upgraded to a partial view room which was really welcome. The negative aspect of this was the noise from the nightly entertainment and very noisy neighbours. I had not noticed how thin the walls were before on both sides but I was woken up before 5.30am by people talking loudly on both sides on the two days I was there. I could actually hear every word they spoke. I ended up banging on the walls which shut them up somewhat, but really I didnt think I had to consider wearing earplugs in a hotel like this.Room service quality is very good and all the staff were, as usual just wonderful especially at reception and at the restaurant. Loved the breakfast! The only surprising exception was at the Mai Tai Bar. Every year I come to Waikiki, even if I dont stay at the hotel, I try and introduce my friends to the MaiTai Bar at sunset. It is one of the best places to watch that incredible nightly spectacle in a congenial atmosphere.This time even though the bar wasnt packed, I had to firstly ask for service (after being ignored for 10 minutes),then when I asked for a menu to see if there was any bar snacks I might have wanted that took a long time and then no one got back to me so I didnt bother ordering. Normally, the barstaff are so friendly and they certainly have fun and acknowledge you. No attempt was made to see if I wanted another drink when I finished the one I had and I had to ask for the check from someone other than the original person who served me, because again, no eye contact, no acknowledgment - and let me agan say this bar was not busy. This whole experience was so unlike what I had experienced before that I was glad I had no guests with me this time.I love this hotel but please, I beg management, dont lose the very things that set you apart- your friendliness,grace and attention to detail."

Customers who had just sat down were not only greeted but given water and had their orders fulfilled. The other customers were offered refills and asked if they needed anything else. We sat there watching. We were horribly discriminated against and have never been treated with such prejudice. When I called the front desk I was offered free drinks. Complimentary refreshment was not going to remedy the situation. The actions of this individual made us feel inferior and should not be tolerated. No one deserves to be treated this way."

Let's be honest their rooms are far from being the best in town and not a good value for money anymore but their staff always made my stay enjoyable .This time around to my surprise I was met by hundreds of employees protesting outside the hotel for several days - in several location across USA.Why ? Turns out Marriott has been paying them not even the min. wage !!! How can you do this to your own staff ? Have you got no dignity ?I couldn't sleep the first night even tho I was as high as 28th floor because the protests and I can't blame them for this . I got up myself and few others staying here got all the people protesting outside hot drinks .If you are coming now / soon beware you will not have a restful sleep because of the ongoing protest , day and night, it seriously had a impact on my trip's outcome and from now on I have cancelled all business trips staying with Marriott . I am actually ashamed of myself because by staying here so often I have been , indirectly , supporting their modern slavery attitude. I will certainly no longer do this !"

        "review_text": "Just checked in and sitting on the bed of my waterfront king hotel room that I am paying over $500 a night for (with taxes, fees and parking). This room should not be in the same category as the other rooms that actually fit the description.First let me start out that the man who checked us did not or could not speak barely three words.  Wrote down a higher level room and then changed it to this horrible room that although we can see the water and bridge, overlooks the cement utility structure out of one window and sani huts out the other (see pictures). All this even though I booked this room back in January, asked for a high level room and told them this was my birthday weekend.My husband tried to complain and another incompetent fellow took us to two other rooms that were just as bad and that do not overlook the water and didn't know what to answer when I asked if they were the same classification of room.All hotels are booked now, and now I am afraid that I am stuck in this hotel with absolutely awful customer service for what was supposed to be an amazing weekend in the city."

        "review_text": "I stayed here in a queen tower room from June 23-28, 2018. Before I booked my stay, I checked the website to see if there were any charges associated with receiving packages. NOTHING.Before I arrived, I emailed the staff to let them know I would be expecting packages. No one mentioned anything about a fee to receive packages. During check in, again no mention of this fee. During my 5-day stay, and at check out, there was again no mention of this fee.I received my invoice today to see that they charged me $82.50 to receive packages, plus another $7.50 for shipping a package -- which ALREADY HAD A FULLY PRE-PAID SHIPPING LABEL.If these charges had been disclosed beforehand or at any point during my stay, I wouldn't be here posting this. But this behavior is very unprofessional and unbefitting of a 4/5 star hotel.I will be disputing this charge."

        "review_text": "Our daughter wanted to throw the New Years Eve Party everyone would remember.  The venue, staff and band (Gold Coast Orchestra) made it all she wanted and then some.  The staff cheerfully helped with every request.  At midnight, the staff fired confetti cannons from the mezzanine.  They may have had as much fun as the guests.Check-in was very easy and efficient.  The bell staff was very courteous and helpful.  They were an excellent first impression of the hotel.  The Christmas decorations in the lobby were beautiful.Because of it's central location in downtown Chicago, there is easy access to numerous locations for wedding experience.  For the true Chicago experience, try Union Station.The sleeping rooms were very nice.  Several guests said they wanted to take the mattress home.  Housekeeping was very understanding of the later than normal access they were given to our room.Because of the terrific downtown Chicago location, the only downside is parking is expensive.  A very small price to pay for such a memorable experience."

        "review_text": "I have just returned from a weeks stay at JBH and will definitely not return. I expected so much more but feel I would have had a better stay in Europe for half the price! I ended up complaining to the tour operator I booked through and to save rewriting I have pasted below:I have bullet pointed our complaints below and also added videos as links for evidence for one of the points.- Our first major issue was the swimming pool scenario. The hotel had one main swimming pool and one childrens pool. Upon arriving for our stay, we went to the childrens pool with our two children (aged 4 and 2) to find that there was a sign saying the pool was closed and would not reopen until 25th May, so for the duration of our stay. We weren't made aware of this and upon getting advice from another travel agent, we should have been aware and offered another hotel if we had chosen.This was mostly disappointing because there were further issues with the other main pool. Firstly, children who cannot swim unaided require life jackets, these were to be hired from the pool area which I knew beforehand so didn't bring my own. I have experienced Dubai before where this has also been the case and found the life jackets to be much more suitable than arm bands. For everyday of our stay, we were only allocated one life jacket for two children as they had no more (we didn't see any children at the pool particularly with a life jacket on) so this was disappointing as I didn't want either in the pool without a swimming aid. I tried to find suitable aids for them but the shop in the hotel didn't sell any and neither did the souk at the Madinat (where I was advised to try). This meant the children had to share a life jacket which is not the kind of experience I would expect.My daughter, being 4.5 and wanting to have fun in the swimming pool was not welcomed at the hotel. She was not allowed to jump in off the side of the pool, sit on the edge of the pool and jump in, be carried on her dads back or shoulders. To be honest, what was the point of it? It's a swimming pool for children to play and have fun. Fun is clearly not encouraged.We were also told my son couldn't go in the pool at all as he wore a swim nappy. He is 2.5 and not yet potty trained so he actually had no access to a swimming pool at all for the holiday which is the main focal point of a childrens holiday so to avoid him being upset, me and him spent most of our time in the room.The next point of our complaint is regarding construction work.We were aware before arriving that there were construction works going on at the hotel which we were made aware would be minimal and not interfere with our holiday. This is shown in some videos attached just how loud the construction works were. This was made worse by the childrens pool being worked on. We could overlook this during the day but what I didn't realise and was never made aware of is that these works are 24/7. They continue throughout the entire night. I have attached another video of the level of noise overnight. This was frustrating as our children were trying to sleep as well as us and the noise mainly consisted of beeping on the vehicles that were reversing, banging noises constantly made for a worse nights sleep. We did complain about this on the phone to reception but nothing could be done.The last point of our complaint, probably the most difficult was that when we checked in (just before midnight) we were told that part of the check in process was paying for a tab for the room so that any charges would go to the room. We advised that we had brought currency with us and wanted to use that and not have a fee on the room. This wasn't acceptable by them. We were then further astonished that the fee they wanted was 3000AED which is \u00a3643. To be asked for that when you have just spent a lot of money on the holiday itself was really shocking and to be honest with yourselves, I didn't have that amount of money. I had spent a lot of money on this holiday plus the other expenditures that go alongside a holiday, clothing, taxi's, airports etc and I was so upset at being asked this. I also wouldn't have spent money on currency had I known I had to do this. This was really distressing for me because I was at check in, nearly midnight, two very tired and upset children desperate to go to bed and I couldn't check in until I had paid this amount.Through our complete luck, when we checked our bank, a recent tax rebate we were due had cleared and we then had the funds to pay. If this hadn't have cleared we would have really been in a difficult position as financially, the trip had been planned really carefully.The team did lower the fee to 2000AED to assist but this was a really difficult scenario that I feel Travel Republic should have made us aware of and will make future passengers aware of.The Jumeirah chain itself is well established and highly thought of which I why I paid extra compared to my other trips to Dubai to visit them. I was really not impressed with the above points which I would have expected to not experience on a 4* trip to Europe let alone a luxury holiday for my family to Dubai!"

        "review_text": "My partner and I stayed for 4 nights (2nd -6th September) and we really enjoyed our stay.When we decided to visit San Francisco my partner spent a long time looking at hotels, we wanted somewhere in a good location, either near tourist spots or close to public transport. After a couple of weeks of research we settled on Stanford Court. We liked the look of the hotel and the reviews on trip advisor encouraged us to book.When we first pulled into the car park we were gobsmacked. The fountain was on, there were doormen that helped us with our luggage and the glass doors showcased the lobby and bar area brilliantly.Check in was efficient and the staff were really welcoming and friendly, we were instantly made to feel that we were valued guests.The room was nice, spacious with a good sized bathroom and a comfortable bed. The tv had a lot of features on it such as Netflix and chrome cast but we didn\u2019t use them. The Wi-Fi was excellent, coming from England were not used to high speed internet so we were really impressed with it. We only had to log in once and as soon as we entered the hotel our phones would instantly reconnect without us having to log in manually each time.The hotel is at the top of Nob Hill which is a ridiculously steep hill. Fortunately the tram stops directly outside the hotel so we only had to walk it twice. If we had noticed the tram stops before, we wouldn\u2019t have walked it at all.The bar area was nice and the staff were knowledgable and helpful. They have a number of different ales and whiskeys from local brewery\u2019s and distillery\u2019s, I have a small whisky collection and this was one of the features that attracted us to Stanford Court.We didn\u2019t realise that the guy sat on the Mac in the lobby was the concierge, we thought it was just a guest using a hotel pc so we probably bothered the reception staff by asking them for recommendations and directions but they were so helpful and knowledgeable that we thought they were doubling up as concierge.We ate in the bar on our last night and the food was brilliant, again the staff were extremely friendly and efficient.We really enjoyed our stay here, the staff were excellent, the drinks were good and the location was perfect.I couldn\u2019t recommend the place enough, if your going to San Francisco then stay here, I wouldn\u2019t stay anywhere else, Stanford Court is my San Francisco home.Thank you to all off the staff for making our holiday so special, you were all excellent and I really hope that this feedback gets back to your managers. See you soon."

        "review_text": "I was so excited to be in hawaii for our last trip before out baby comes. WORST hotel 1st impression of my life. First off we booked a queen room and ended up in a room with 2 double beds. Mind you i am very pregnant it was a very tight fit. Next the washroom was Filthy HAIRS and left over SOAP all over like it wasn't even cleaned after the last guest. So dirty I felt like showering in my shoes. Next one of the beds were covered in stains not sure if the sheets were changed. It was very disappointing walking into this hotel after seeing such nice photos and pretty good reviews. The photos are OLD this hotel seems run down really needs a reno. My husbands biggest complaint is there is ZERO control over the thermostat main reason is it will only run while the key card is placed in the room wall unit that supplies power to the room, also all lights are turned on when power in being fed to the room with no light switches to turn them off. When you sleep the key comes out to turn lights off. This was leaving our room either too hot or too cold because as soon as we leave the thermostat turns off. Dont know about you but I am not about to leave my room key in the suite. Do your self a favor and book something else."

        "review_text": "I should start by saying we stay at mass market hotels typically. Marriott, Hyatt, etc... and occasional Four Seasons. We don't mind the lower ends like Hampton Inn on occasion either. We go to Hawaii at least once a year. Usually for a week or two.  I should add that I dislike Waikiki from every other time we have stayed there. I prefer a quieter spot of the island like Ko Olina. However, my wife likes Waikiki and this was just a four night trip. Doing research I noticed that the RH is hidden away off the busy street, has a decent sized beach, a quiet pool and access to the big \"fun\" pool next store at the Sheraton. So we went for it.Let me say it was really unbelievable. Each time we walked in (easy to walk because you are dead center of Waikiki) it was like an amazing peace and quiet surrounded us. Even the one time walking from the Sheraton back to the RH was like going from Chaos to peace. Let me stress the location. It really is perfect. Tons of good restaurants right there as well as bars, shopping, etc.... The restaurants are mostly familiar chains but also some smaller local places as well.  The location is really the best on Waikiki. When we go back we will stay there again!Let me say the only complaints are minor:- Food at Mai Tai Bar was over-priced. My little salad was the size of a side salad, with no meat, and cost $18. However, it's a \"fancy\" hotel so it's part of the drill.- Upon check in I was bothered that they re-asked my wife's name as they had emailed me about a week earlier and I had given them the info. If you want to be five stars you should have those small details down.- Sheets were clean (actually sheets were amazing - check the price online for frette sheets) but had some permanent stains. Looked like they had gotten stuck in the washer or dryer door and gotten sort of a grease stain. Expected at a Courtyard by Marriott but not a \"five star\" property.- 2 or 3 smoking areas in the otherwise beautiful garden area. Maybe you could move those to one area in the back alley!?- Pool at the hotel is tiny but pool next store is huge and we did have easy access to it.What else....Many people on tripadvisor complain about the $40/$50 price for a beach chair. We didn't rent it but it seemed reasonable to me. It was $40 for back row, or $50 for beach front row, for TWO chairs and an umbrella.  That's per day. Seemed perfectly reasonable to me. This is Hawaii.Our rate included breakfast. The breakfast was good. They encourage buffet but you could also order off the menu. Very good service at the breakfast. We went out one day but the other days ate their.Valet parking is included in the mandatory resort fee so rent a car and stash it for free. We only took ours out once but the rental car fees are pretty cheap, if you know where to look, and it's nice to tour the island.Housekeeping was excellent and unobtrusive.Staff throughout the hotel was friendly.As stated above... we will be back!"

The wood-paneled, votive-lit Hay-Adams room was beautiful for the ceremony, and the Lafayette Room, where we had the reception and dancing, was beyond elegant. And the food was superb. Our catering manager, Rebecca Ventura, guided us through every step of the planning and all of her suggestions were excellent. So it was not only a magical wedding, it felt almost effortless.We stayed in one of the Hay-Adams' wonderful suites, and a bottle of chilled sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries awaited us after the ceremony. Every member of the staff was exceedingly gracious, and our experience with the Hay-Adams was wonderful from beginning to end."

        "review_text": "My wife and I were in town for 3 nights, seeing two concerts at Wrigley Field. Why choose the Drake? We wanted a quiet, comfortable place when we returned, a place we knew would have good beds and air conditioning and unobtrusive service. That's exactly what we got.Yes, our room faced Walton Place, that is, the back of the hotel. Perfect. It was absolutely quiet. Try finding that. The air conditioning was precise in temperature and whisper-quiet. And the Hilton bedding was as comfortable as one can imagine.As Diamond members, we got a free breakfast in the executive lounge on the top of the hotel facing Lake Michigan. It was a great breakfast, with eggs, pastries, juice, etc.I had a terrific martini at Coq D'Or, which had a lively bar scene just when one needs it - 5:30 p.m. on a Thursday.Maybe most important, nobody disturbed us when we wanted to be left alone, and we got service when we asked for it.Yes, there are things that could be improved. The furniture is nice but the decor is not contemporary and in places is a little tired. Our blackout shades, which worked well, did have a little dust on them. And in case you didn't know, they've closed the Cape Cod Room.But let's hope that when The Drake decides to go through a facelift, it doesn't mess up the things that are great. Chicago doesn't need another contemporary hotel. There are hundreds of them already. It needs more places like The Drake."

        "review_text": "Happy new year. This has to be one of the toughest reviews ever- I like the hotel and the staff are very nice and helpful- so why only 3 stars?  STUFF.  When we arrived at 6 p.m. we were told the room may not be ready- not good but they bought us a glass of wine at the bar while we waited- only like 15 minutes. Room is ready! Room. Well, not good. Windows look at a wall with windows into another room- really? I booked a view room. Went to front desk and explained- they have no \"view\"rooms.  So, they move us to an outside room, thank you. Well, the room has no central air or heat- instead a window unit and portable heater? O.K. Why? The room is spacious for 2 of us but nothing is set up for 2- one robe, one cup for the expresso ( which is silly).  The shower is spacious but the handheld doesn't work -  housekeeping misses us 2 nights but the hotel gives us a credit which was great service.  The restaurant at the hotel is AMAZING!  Total winner- the bar at the hotel, not so much. Overworked it appears since their attitude was stressed and twice we sat and no one even asked us if we needed anything. The day of check out- no late check out- o.k. so check out is noon.  At 11:30 with a do not disturb on the door, housekeeping shows up and knocks on the door?  So, as you can see, the hotel is nice- the service is great - but the \"experience\" not so much.  Next time in SF, not sure this would be our first choice.  DEFINITELY , check out  the restaurant - fantastic."

        "review_text": "Stayed here for a one week family vacation.As a Diamond HHONORS member I was a little disappointed that they were not able to provide an upgrade to an executive floor or an ocean view room.  That being said, the mountain views from our room were still quite beautiful.Despite not being upgraded to the executive floor, we were still given access to the executive lounge on the lower level.  Contrary to some previous posts, we found the lounge to be plenty adequate. For breakfast, they were open 6-9 M-F and 7-10 Sat-Sun.  Breakfast included both hot and cold items and was all kept fresh and tasty.  Although it was repetitive when staying a full week, the free breakfast saved us a lot of money and started every day off nice.  For the evening appetizers, those were served from 5-7 each evening and also included both hot and cold items.  There was enough variety that we decided to make that our dinner a few nights, again saving us quite a bit of money rather than going out.  In addition, the soft drinks, etc were available in the lounge throughout the day.The biggest disappointment for us were the beds.  In our room (1715), the mattresses seemed quite worn/saggy and uncomfortable, making it hard to get a good night sleep.  In addition, as others have commented, the bathroom windows are a terrible oversight. The problem is that, even with the blinds shut, if you turn on either of the bathroom light switches it illuminates the entire bedroom.  When you are staying in a room with a wife and young children, inevitably someone will get up to use the restroom at some point.  Normally it's not an issue, but here the entire room lights up resulting in everyone in the room now being awake.  It doesn't help that Hawaii is five time zones away from our home which already through off our sleep schedule. It seems like it would be an easy fix to either put in a small light that wouldn't shine through or replace the blinds with something that doesn't let so much light through.Enough with the gripes and back to the positives.  The pool/beach towel checkout was available both in the lobby level and at the pool deck.  You simply swipe your room key and take what you need, then return them later to the same spot.  They presumably use RFID chips to track them being checked in and out.The pool area on the 10th floor was nice.  Both the pool and hot tub were comfortable temperatures. The area was clean with plenty of available loungers and some beds as well.  There was a nice pool bar, filtered water machine, and clean restrooms.  Everything you could want in a pool deck, even if the pool is on the slightly smaller side.The beach is only a short walk from the hotel.  There are plenty of options when you get to the water.  If you are with smaller children or maybe want to swim laps, go straight to the beach and there is an area with breakers that keep waves to a minimum. If waves are what you want take a left (or right) when you get to the beach and the next areas down will have plenty of waves to meet your needs.There are several restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. If you want to stay at the hotel instead, Mac 24/7 serves great food and is open all hours as the name applies.  I tried the moonfish tacos and pulled pork sandwiches during our stay, and both were outstanding. The lobby bar also has happy hour from 5-7 and then live music at 7 each evening.  This was nice to come back to and enjoy a drink after busy days.  Best off, charging to your room accrues more HHONORS points (even on award stays) at both the bar and Mac 24/7.Service was friendly from nearly everyone we encountered, particularly the housekeeping staff.Overall, this was a great value relative to other options in the area and served as a perfect home base for our vacation.  Despite the couple complaints in the room, everything else was fantastic and I would be happy to visit again if I ever get another chance to return to Hawaii."

        "review_text": "We stayed in Marriott Grand Chateau for a night on our recent trip to Las Vegas. The place is situated bang in the middle of the Strip area, just off the main road.We had a one room villa in the new tower, which was spacious, neat and spotless. The area had a bedroom, living area and a fully furnished kichenette. The bedroom was very spacious with a large, comfortable bed and an in-room jacuzzi :) The bath was also spacious and very clean with a double shower. We had a gorgeous view of the Strip from both our bedroom and living room. The kitchen had everything you'd need to do all your cooking - a fridge, oven, plates, cooking utensils.. as well as a 6-seater dining table. The hotel does not have a casino, which makes it very quiet. There is a full service cafe where you can also get a quick bite. There is a rooftop pool which is supposed to have a lovely view of the Strip, but unfortunately it was closed on the night we were around due to high winds. The staff at the hotel are extremely polite and helpful. We got our room at 11am even though the actual check in time is 4pm, without any extra charge. The location is excellent with close proximity to the best hotels of the Strip. Planet Hollywood, Aria and the Bellagio are right across the street.overall our stay was extremely comfortable and we wish we couldve stayed longer. We will gladly recommend it to anyone who is visiting!"

They demonstrated the perfect balance of courtesy, speed, and responsiveness, delivered with authentic spirit.  I believed they were really happy I was there, because I suspect they are happy being there themselves.  First time ever I can say, \"This was a perfect experience.\"  And I was there on business and not in a particularly good mood.  That is until I got back to the hotel, where their attention brought me back to \"life.\""

        "review_text": "Hopefully you'll find out that this is actually two properties - the Georgetown Suites located at 1111 30th Street NW, which is a fabulous property with many fine amenities.The Georgetown Suites Harbor Building is next to it, at 1000 29th Street NW, which is a 50 year old probably former apt building of some sort, with no view of the harbor as far as I can tell (unless you have a room on the side towards the Potomac that is above the raised highway that runs right next to it.Interestingly the address on our booking was 30th Street. We pulled into a lovely courtyard where I saw two livery vehicles, one a Town Car and one Suburban (more on that later). I was immediately impressed; however, it was shortlived as we found out we were to stay in the \"other building\". Again interestingly one of the main photos on their website shows the street along that entrance, which has the nice old buildings that Georgetown is known for. However, there's no courtyard to pull into. You park on the street and haul your stuff in about 50 yards to the \"front desk\". When I saw it it reminded me of a Motel 6, and I only got worse from there.Our \"one bedroom suite\", as others have mentioned was probably half the size of a typical suite, and the bedroom was just about big enough for the bed - and no window. If you wanted to change your mind you would have to step out of the bathroom, its so small. As others have said, the kitchen appliances and furniture are something you would have discarded 30 years ago.The one window looked out onto 29th, but funneled all the sound from the aforementioned overhead highway nicely.The heat and ac system did work but you have to hear to believe how noisy it is.So, the car service: I asked at our front desk about this and was told \"we don't do that\" - apparently what they meant is that they don't do it for the Harbor Building guests. Now I didn't expect free car service, but having a vehicle we could call on (as there were 5 of us) would have been very handy, even if they charged more than a typical cab. The rather grumpy front desk clerk didn't even offer to help me get a cab either, and very few actually go down 29th street anyway.So, make sure you know what your getting when you book.After coming home and looking at the website again, I'm even more outraged since nowhere on there did I see it talk about this."

        "review_text": "This is the WORST hotel experience I have ever had.  BED BUGS!  DO NOT STAY HERE!  Aside from checking out of the hotel with 4 bed bug bites, 9 bed bug bites for one of my other friends, and 3 for the third friend staying in the same room, hotel management did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to accommodate us!First, we checked into our hotel room, and the a/c was broken.  Then we find out the refrigerator was on, but didn't even keep our foods/bottled waters cold.  Everything placed into the refrigerator was stored at room temperature hours and days later.  Then, the hair dryer doesn't work.  Next, we pull the pull out bed from the couch and there is a huge disgusting brown stain on the mattress.  Then comes the worse of all, bed bugs.  Three out of five guests in the room woke up with itchy bed bug bites.  We go downstairs to the front desk clerk, Geri, to tell her about the awful situation.  She calls a third party contracted company and has the 3/5 of us fill out a claim informing us that the hotel's insurance company would be reaching out to us in a few days.  In addition, they had us pack all of our belongings, and the hotel moves us into a different room. This process took over an hour, and it was the most inconvenient experience for a vacation.In this new room, the sink was broken.  We had to turn it a specific way in order for it to turn off and not waste water. Great... We were already behind schedule for our day activities, but made it back in time to get ready for dinner.  One of the guests in our room sat on the couch for about an hour while waiting for the bathroom to be free so that she could have her turn to shower.  She gets off the couch, and finds 3 new bed bug bites.  At this point, we are disgusted and do NOT want to stay here.  We call the front desk, and the same process occurs. Third party contracted company comes up to our room, the guest that got bit fills out a claim, and they want to move us AGAIN.  We do NOT want to pack all our things again. We want to check out of this disgusting hotel.Both the night shift supervisor, Steph and hotel manager, Adam, advised that they could not offer any refund, waive any hotel resort or parking fees, or do anything to accommodate us except move us to a different room.  WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE WANT TO MOVE ROOMS AGAIN when the same situation occurred.  The risk of moving rooms is the same as staying in the bug infested room.  We even asked, \"what would you want the hotel to do for you if you were in our situation?\" And they both responded with \"we would want to be compensated.\"  Exactly. We wanted our refunds or ANYTHING to better the situation, but neither did NOTHING!!  We clearly did not want to pack all of our belongings and move rooms AGAIN.  Adam repeatedly said everything is dealt through the hotel's insurance, and it would be against hotel policy to waive the approximate $25 resort fees per night and $27 parking per night.  This totaled to $209 in fees that we had to pay.  We figured this situation would be an exception, but they made no effort to better the situation. We were furious. WE ARE NEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN, and this is a warning to all guests.  This hotel needs to be thoroughly inspected, and the priority of the hotel needs to be shifted to care more for their customers because that was clearly lacking."

        "review_text": "I travel more than I am home, all over the country. This is my first experience staying at a Trump property; I was pretty stoked when I booked it. Beautiful building, great location, adequate accommodations at the \"entry\" room level and the Trump has the appearance of a class organization - to some it probably is. I am writing this review because of the experience (or lack of) I had last two nights coming \"home\" after a very long day at work.5 star hotel, the Trump. Who opened the door for me upon my return? No one. Who greeted me and said, \"welcome back\"? No one. Who at the desk looked up and seemed pleased that I had chosen the Trump as my refuge away from home? No one. I just let myself in and headed to the elevator, two nights in a row. I am not one to need such niceties but I admit I expected more of a reception staying a 5 star establishment. The first night, I wrote the lack of personal attention off as an anomaly. Unfortunately, tonight was a repeat performance of last night upon my return. Perhaps I do not appear \"tip worthy\"? Trivial? I am afraid not in the realm of hospitality.The rooms are clean and well kept. My TV was tuned to the fish tank channel and there was a robe laid out on my bed when I came in to my room both nights but I felt somewhat an intruder; a gypsy in the palace perhaps. My overall impression is one of an efficient, utilitarian, but cold machine. I can get a smile, a clean bed, and some friendly conversation at a lower rate at a number of other hotels. Money is really not an issue for me but service and smiles are. If you want to feel at home, away from home, look elsewhere."

So upon entering I was greeted by the manager with a  beautiful lei and a warm towel .  Room was very nice I did pay a small feee for a corner suite on the beach side ,well worth the money , had a great view of the salt water pool down belowAt lunch I enjoyed a really good meal ate the hotel restaurant / bar called the Hide out that was amazing. They have 2 fire pits very lounge environment very cozy some artist playing music in the corner. I see why they call it hideout nestled 15 feet above Kuhio st gives you a nice view I imagine at night with fire pits going it is even better . Definitely a must try.

        "review_text": "Over the past several years I stayed several times at the Hotel Burnham, a charming boutique hotel in the historic Reliance Building, one of Chicago's most famous landmarks.  Some months ago I made a reservation for yet another stay at the Burnham, but was alarmed to discover a couple of weeks ago, just before I was scheduled to arrive, that it had changed hands, is no longer a Kimpton Hotel, and now belongs to the Pineapple (!) chain.  Upon arrival I was dismayed to find that many of the things that made the Burnham so pleasant have been stripped away.  The cosy lobby with comfortable chairs and sofas facing a roaring fire is gone, as is the late afternoon wine party.  The once opulent Atwood Dining Room has been redecorated to look like a lunch counter.  The guest rooms have always been on the small size, but were formerly decorated in rich blues and golds.  Now, everything is grey and dull.  The bulky new beds fill the rooms and leave no space for chairs, floor lamps, etc.  The bathrooms are fitted with awkwardly placed Tommy Bahama soap dispensers, poorly located at the wash basin, but totally out of reach for anyone who wants to have a bath.  When I asked for a bar of soap, two bars were delivered to the room.  The staff made every effort to be friendly and helpful, but I deeply regret that everything that made me want to return time and again to the Burnham has been lost.  Such a shame that they had to spoil a really good things."

        "review_text": "We stayed here in October for 4 nights. We are a family of 4 with 2 young boys. This was the perfect hotel for us. The rooms are huge and there are seperate areas--so the kids can go to bed while the grown-up can relax (though we were usually too tired to do so). It was great having a mini fridge and small sink so that we could bring our own snacks and drinks. It is relatively quiet at night. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful! It was so convenient and the food was good as well (although the coffee was not great--thank goodness for Starbucks on the basement level!!!). There is also a pool at the top level which my boys enjoyed. The Metro is in the basement level of the Galleria, which made getting around extremely easy. The staff were very helpful and friendly. All in all, we had a great stay and are planning to be back in April."

        "review_text": "On 11/12/2016, I arrived at Tahiti Village for a one week stay.  The experience was generally good except for the last day.  As I was loading up to check out, I noticed that a heavy duty plastic tool box was missing from the rear of my van where it had been firmly attached to a metal tray and padlocked.  The tray was visible from anywhere in the parking lot.   Some of the screws and part of the plastic box bottom were still attached.  The van was parked at the door of building #2, and in an area I was told was a safe parking spot.  I learned the parking area of the village has security cameras that only cover the sidewalk.  There is no coverage of the parking area, or the rear of the van.  I returned home and received an e-mail from the security director on 11/29/2016, advising me to make a police report with the Las Vegas Metro Police Dept., and turn the loss in to my insurance company.  I was informed how the security staff is on patrol 24 hours a day.  However, I have learned this was not an isolated incident.  I am writing this to inform other travelers who drive to the Tahiti Village to beware of the parking lot."

        "review_text": "We booked our Waikki eight day vacation through Westjet Vacations from Jan 11-18th and found this amazing gem. Our priority was a family hotel, clean, affordable, comfortable and CLOSE TO THE BEACH. We checked first on its reviews, googled the images and videos and of course, google maps for its location. On all accounts this hotel meet all our needs and them some.Location: Our goal was beach time and had no plans on staying at the hotel for extended periods of time except to sleep. There is no other affordable hotel that can compare to the location and beach access than Aston Waikiki Circle. From the lobby elevator to the beach is about 50 Meters. We were there for a restful beach vacation and this was it.The hotel was walking distance to everything.* Major Shopping was five minutes away.* McDonalds, Egg and Things, and ABC store right beside hotel. There are ten ABC stores within five minutes of the hotel* a variety of local markets close by depending on day of the week.* we bought grocery staples from the Food Pantry which is a ten minutes walk.* We preferred the surf shop two rights from hotel and one block back. The shop was cheaper and staff much more knowledgable than the Beach rentals.* Dukes is less than a ten minute walk and amazing patio.Service: No matter our questions and needs, the front desk staff were always willing to help. From Beach towels to extra room cleaning to directions and suggestions on restaurants, the staff were always helpful. They also went the extra mile for we arrived late at night (10:00 PM) and the front desk staff person suggested to come back the next morning because they had rooms on higher floors. We lucked out and were moved from Second floor to the thirteenth floor!There is also a tour desk opposite side to the Front Desk Office. We booked our Hanauma Bay tour through the desk with ease.Across the parking lot from the front desk is a Surf Board storage area. The Hotel suggests guests who are leaving to donate their beach things. We used inflatables, beach chairs, boogies boards, beach mats during our stay and when we left, we added a couple of inflatables and beach umbrella to the pile.Rooms: We travel a great deal and appreciate a good affordable, clean and comfy room. Its the only way we can afford to travel so often. Every room in the Circle is the same with two double beds, bathroom (shower no bathtub), large closet, air conditioner, fridge, coffee and tea maker, and small office area and deck space. The only difference is the views. We had an partial ocean view room and loved waking up to the sunrise and seeing the sunset before we were off for a late dinner. We regularly posted photos to Facebook and our friendly regularly asked where we were staying.There are two double beds with bed spreads. The beds for our family of four were soft and comfortable. I did encounter a man checking out early complaining about bed size and room size but clearly he had not researched the hotel before booking. This is not the Hyatt or Outrigger with the duvets on the king beds.Part of the charm of the hotel is the history. It is an older hotel but that was certainly apart of the appeal. The rooms were definitely freshly painted and all furniture were up to date. My suggestion is to stay here before some large chain buys it and tears it down to build a mega hotel.Family: My wife and I traveled with our tall 11 year old son and 8 year old daughter. The hotel was perfect for our family of four. The area was safe especially with a Waikiki Police office two blocks away. We arrived late the first night and walked no problem to Dukes Statue to donate our Leis and shopped at a few stores before going to bed."

        "review_text": "We love this hotel!! It is modern, clean, quiet, and right on the edge of the Waikiki strip. It is the perfect place to relax in the beauty of Oahu and still enjoy the nightlife of Waikiki.Modern Honolulu has two gorgeous pools, a night club, a quiet bar with live music, and great restaurants. Balconies are spacious and provide a good view of the marina and ocean.The rooms are spacious and have many comforts. Beds are comfortable, sheets are relatively soft, and the bathroom has beautiful fixtures and finishes, a large shower, and lovely bath products.As a Diamond owner, I would like to see a small kitchen in each room (as is usual for Diamond properties).Although there is no beach at this property, the sand is a short 3 minute walk.If you like being close to the action but prefer avoiding the noise of all the action, this is the place for you."

WHAT??!????!! I am SOO disappointed with this place. The rooms are OK for the money you spend to stay here I expect better customer service. The shampoo/conditions in the room are very cheap, no robes, something I would expect from an extended stay type of place not a hotel that charges what this place does. They nickel and dime you for every extra little thing! I have been to motels that have their hot tubs open to midnight all year round! I just can not believe they don't keep AT LEAST ONE hot tub open later. I spoke with Justin a \"manager\" here who was no help, not apologetic at all and did not offer any solution to compensate for this. They charge $30/day for resort fee, well that's a joke! What exactly am I paying for???? They even charge for parking (mandatory valet)! I will not be coming back here or recommending friends to this place. Shame on them that they operate this way."

        "review_text": "We are so disappointed ,We arrived this morning expecting usual Jumeirah Beach Hotel standards and have been nothing but disappointed .We were unable to visit this hotel last year due to refurbishments.We come every year with children,grandchildren,relatives from abroad etc.This time we decided to come as a couple to make use of the amazing executive lounge.We arrived to realise that no longer was check in carried out on floor 24. Usually when we arrive early morning we have breakfast in Latitude,now called kitchen something or other.We were told to have breakfast in the downstairs premium lounge (where they were unable to cook an omelette properly...even after being told)Executive pool as usual was fabulous as was our room.This evening,as we hadn\u2019t slept last night,we decided to eat in Latitude .For anyone who doesn\u2019t know,Latitude was renown for having the best buffet in Dubai.When we previously stayed in Burj al Arab We still went to Latitude for their buffet.This evening we visited and for  anyone  who hasn\u2019t visited before it\u2019s probably quite acceptable.But if you have been here previously you will realise the standard in their buffet has dropped dramatically.I think this will most definitely be our last visit to this hotel as the same can be obtained far cheaper elsewhere.I find thisvery sad as we have been coming here for over 20 years."

        "review_text": "I'm originally from Hawaii and regularly stay at this iconic old Hawaii Hotel when I'm here for work and play.Location:  towards the end of Waikiki and on a nice stretch of beach, not as crowded as the patch in front of park across from the Hyatt.Common Areas:  refurbished building but with all the old Aloha charm.  Rocking chairs on the Lanai, Banyan tree in the courtyard.  Airy and open lobby with lots of comfy seating both inside and in the back porch.Room Types:  This is the most important decision to manage your expectations.  I've always booked directly on the SPG website, so I know exactly he kind of room and in which wing it will be.  All the rooms are updated but vary in size and feel.Tower Wing:  This is the newest addition and is a high rise structure. Typically the most expensive room type.  Pros:  Rooms are huge and all have an outdoor covered balcony with space for seating outside.  Bathrooms are also large and has tub. High floors are also very quiet. It's also closest to the Spa, gym and club lounge. Cons: Rooms are decorated in the standard Westin white, so it doesn't have the unique Hawaii charm.  I always try to stay here for because of the room size and quietness.Diamond Wing:  This is in the old building extension in a low rise structure.  Rooms are medium in size and has a indoor balconey.   Part of the main room has wood floors and there are rocking chairs in the area to mimic an outdoor patio, but it's in the room.  The slider doors are large and opens but it's essentially a floor-to-ceiling window with railing, no actual outdoor space to sit.  Pro:  room has more Hawaii charm and in a charming structure.  Cons:  Bathrooms are tiny overall, 1/2 the size of Tower rooms and shower only.  There's only room for one in the bathroom.  Rest of room is average in size but comfortable for 2 people.  Lower floors can be noisy as the ocean view rooms overlook the patio below used for weddings and events.  If no other choice, will pick this room type.Banyan Wing:  this is usually the lowest priced room.  It's in the original building and in a low rise structure.  Pros:  Rooms are decorated with the most Hawaiian feel.  Ocean view rooms have a picturesque view of Diamond Head.  Cozy window seat.  Cons: Rooms are the smallest of the 3, even by NYC standards and not much space to store luggage.  Practically, the room is only comfortable for 1 person.  The bathrooms are also tiny and only has a shower.  Very little counter space for toiletry.  For the price, this is not a great value.  I avoid this room type as much as possible.Staff:  efficient and warm.  Know me by name now and very helpful.Hotels are very full right now, so book early to avoid escalating rates."

Oh, and their elevators are high tech and efficient.Lastly, Roy at the front desk was the best! Roy is such a patient person who really took his time with each of his interactions with me and my family. Roy remembered us each time, and was always hospitable and ready to engage.

        "review_text": "I have three words - STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!  This is my second, and my last disappointing experience with Westgate because I will avoid them like the plague in the future.  And lest you think I'm just being a jerk, I'll give you some specifics.  We reserved a deluxe 2-bedroom which was supposed to have a king in the master and 2 doubles or queens in the other bedroom.  We were given a standard 2-bedroom which had a king and a queen.  This meant that our two grandchildren had to either share a bed or have one of them sleep on the sleeper sofa which took up the entire \"living\" area.  They insisted that they didn't know what the D2B on my reservation meant and would only move me to the unit I had reserved if I paid an additional $25 a night.  The standard unit was positively claustrophobic.    The entire \"kitchen is about 8' X 10', with the dishwasher under the sink.  To access the \"laundry\" you have to move the dining table out of the way of the doors.  The floors creak, the doors creak, and the floor in the master is so slanted the drawers on the night stand won't stay closed.  The closet in the master bedroom is tucked away in the corner and barely accessible.  To shower in the master bedroom, you have to climb into this ridiculous 2 person jacuzzi tub that takes up a third of the bedroom and use the hand-held sprayer.  There's hardly room to move.  Apparently all the TV's are connected, because if the kids are watching a DVD in the living area, neither of the 2 bedroom TV's will work.  And by the way, that beautiful pond they show on the website with the ducks floating peacefully, yeah, that's empty and there is construction tape everywhere on the property.  I will say, when we called the front desk to say that there was a scorpion on the ceiling in the kids room, they were quick to come and kill it and offered to spray the place the next morning.  Wi-fi is $9.95 a day and is only for one device. We went on the 90-minute preview of their new property because we actually wanted to see what it was like.  After 4 hours, we took a cab back instead of waiting another hour for the shuttle to take us. The representative was quite angry with us, and told the concierge desk that we didn't finish the tour!!!  She made it clear she thought we were pretty stupid for not taking advantage of such a great deal.   The staff for the most part seems friendly and helpful so I have to believe that this is just a case of really poor management.   So, if anyone is interested, we were in unit 1321, but my advice would be to just not stay here.  I've given it a 2 rating because technically it has everything you need, but it is so far from being what I consider nice it is truly unbelieveable."

The elevator was packed full. We waited 45 mins trying to get on the 1 elevator that was working. There was a whole group of people waiting to get on with us. We had a spa apt at noon and had to leave. So we walked down 10 floors of stairs to the emergency exit which led us on the outside of the side of the hotel which then we walked all the way around. We were now late & could not reschedule our salon which we were out $200 due to the hotel's elevators not working. We asked to speak to the manager immediately & explained what happened. He wasn't even apologetic. He said if you run you can still make it. It was 11:45am & we still had to get to the parkng lot. He was very rude & said he couldn't do anything about it because their system was down & his screen was black. We paid $350 for a suite & was treated terribly by the management. We will never stay here again & will tell everyone about the poor customer service!!!!!"

The beach is a good 15 minute walk from the hotel around a kids lagoon which gets you to the bland coral clad (watch your feet getting in the water) end of Waikiki beach. The shopping district & array of restaurants is also 15-20 minutes walk away, this isn't the end of the world but the hotel itself is a tacky old building with a makeover.The whole facade is based around a trendy bar for people in their 20's centered around a heavily chlorinated pool with limited lounges.Staff attitudes were extremely poor - no one seemed genuinely friendly, good tips weren't remembered and they seemed to be putting their hand out constantly for anything (even checking you into the wrong room).Do yourself a favour and find a hotel closer to the beach and the action - unless you're 23, in good nick and carrying a bag of party gear."

        "review_text": "This was our second stay at this property, though the first time since ownership transferred from Starwood hotels.  It's still an extremely nice property within easy walking distance to Waikiki without all the throngs of tourists at your front door.  We were on the 12th floor with very nice views of Diamond Head and the ocean.  The rooms were very nice, roomy by most Honolulu standards.  The temperature was such that we were able to have our balcony doors slightly open at night to hear the ocean.  The hotel does require cars to be valet parked, but the cost is reasonable.  There are amenities offered such as bottled water (from valet) and cold water in the lobby.  Bicycles are available for use for free.  Also, there is a shuttle that runs to all the Aqua hotels and the Ala Moana Center (shopping center) which is nice if you need to run to the mall, or you want to ride to downtown Honolulu locations.The one downside for the hotel is the extremely limited breakfast.  There are a few ala cart items available (cereal, muffins, fruit), but the selection is very limited.  It would be best if you planned on eating elsewhere for breakfast if possible.  We ended up going to \"Barefoot Beach\" which was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel."

It took us getting rather short with them before they gave us a room. Even then, we ended up having to go to another hotel for half of our stay. To add insult to injury, when I asked them to arrange to have our luggage transferred, they informed me there would be a fee for that. Apparently at the Four Seasons, the customer is always wrong. Don't believe the hype about luxury and service here. It's just another corporate hotel with underpaid staff and overpriced rooms.Oh, and the latte they graciously didn't charge us for while they kept us waiting was terrible."

        "review_text": "I stayed at Hotel Zelos on a recommendation through my company's travel center. The hotel had decent enough ratings, so I wasn't worried going into my trip. The room was smaller than expected, and the cleaning staff didn't pay the closest attention to detail, but overall the amenities were fine. However, when I checked out of my hotel room, I left some baggage at the front desk for safe keeping. Upon my return, I was told my luggage had been given to a different guest, but the hotel staff would 'keep me updated' about when it was returned. No one called me to update me about anything, and I had to return to hotel to get a number that I could call. The fact that this wasn't provided to be as soon as the incident occurred is unacceptable. Finally, two days after the incident, the Director of Hoteling spoke with me, and told me that no, my bag wasn't given to another guest, it was stolen out of the hotel storage facility. He gave me his word that the hotel would assume full responsibility for all the belongings in the bag, however, it has been over a month and I haven't been reimbursed for anything. Their insurance company has been a nightmare to work with. Slow response times, unapologetic and failing to understand how frustrating this situation is. I could not be more disappointed with what many customer have considered a 'great hotel', but I have experienced anything but."

        "review_text": "One thing this hotel does well is customer service!  From the on-to-it guys on the bell desk, to the smiley faces on front reception to the polite and courteous house keeping staff.  Going back to the hotel at the end of our busy days felt like we were being greeted by friends.   Thank you for making our 9 day stay feel like home.TRANSPORT TIPS for those of us who refuse to drive on the otherside of the road:- Free shuttle to Ala Moana (although we tipped the driver a few bucks for 3 of us).- Catch the #22 bus ($2.50) across road by the beach to get to Hanauma Bay (this is also where the green and orange line trolleys stop).- Bus #8 stops right outside the hotel (as does a few others, check thebus.org).- Shark tours & PCC pick ups are at the Marriott Hotel on  Paoakalani Ave (short walk around the corner).- Pink Line Trolley stops at the Aston Hotel just next door.- Swap Meet - Catch the #42 bus ($2.50) just down the road on the cnr of Kapahulu/Kuhio OR the Purple Line Trolley is $25pp all day OR for 3 of us, it cost $7.50 to get there on bus and $50 taxi back to Park Shore (because our shopping was horrendous!)- Walmart - the free shuttle includes a stop at Pagoda Hotel, close to Walmart, OR you shuttle there and it's a $15 taxi ride back to Park Shore + $3 tip (if you have to buy more suitcases!).Hope this helps your planning.Free wi-fi all over the hotel.Shout out to the guys and girls on the front reception who provided exceptional service!  We'll be back for sure"

        "review_text": "I can't understand why this hotel gets such high ratings on TripAdvisor. Although it technically fronts the beach there are actually 2 restaurants taking up all the hotel beach front space. There is only a walkway to the sand and all the sand space is devoted to expensive beach umbrellas for hire. So the reality is that you can go in for a swim but not sit on the beach or in the resort and watch the world go by.This would be ok if the pool was good. But it's squashed between 2 high rise buildings, often in shade and tiled with dark tiles. It's also very deep with most of it at 9 foot deep and very little pool under 5 foot. Not good for kids or non swimmers.Our room was very nice, but some are very close to the building beside. These rooms seem to have no balcony. Staff were ok, not rude but not especially helpful either.It's in a good area with a vibrant night life along Lewers St.Overall a pleasant room but not a nice place to hang out for a holiday. Disappointing."

We were concerned when we learned that it was going to change to a Waldorf.But I have to say it was a lot of fun to be there during the change over.  People were excited about the changes, but also a little nervous.We went to dinner on Thursday night and arrived back to our room to find that many of the Mandarin branded items in our room were replaced with Waldorf branded robes, pads, pens and toiletries.  There were also some items that were \"unbranded\" such as room service menus that were titled \"Eat and Drink\".  Carpeting was being changed and signs were being replaced around the hotel.Most if not all of the staff has remained the same and that is the important part of the hotel.We visit once a year and we look forward to seeing the changes that will happen over the next year."

        "review_text": "At check-in we received a Hilton Diamond member upgrade to a Mountain View room with an adjacent parlor. Lots of space for our 6 day stay! Executive Lounge Breakfast was great and the servers were friendly and helpful. The \u201cevening snack\u201d (pasta, ravioli, wings, spring rolls depending on the day) was so good that a few times it served as our dinner. The pool area had plenty of chairs and cabanas; the only slight drawback was lack of sun from around 10am until noon because it was blocked by adjacent buildings. Service throughout the hotel was excellent. One caution: the \u201cconcierge\u201d is apparently not employed by Hilton. They identified themselves as being \u201cfrom Expedia\u201d and they tried to talk us into certain activities that seemed to be from a preferred vendor list. They would not book us on a catamaran sunset sail with the only vendor (Mana Kai) who had an opening because they weren\u2019t \u201cfamiliar\u201d with them so I booked it myself online and we ended up having an awesome time! This isn\u2019t necessarily Hilton\u2019s fault but it\u2019s always better when the concierge is employed by the hotel.Regardless, we highly recommend the Hilton Waikiki Beach!"

        "review_text": "I've read the other reviews and I have to admit that I was really apprehensive about what we would fine when we arrived at our Expedia-booked package, which included this hotel. So it is possible that my expectations were so low that I was pleasantly surprised. It is NOT a plush, luxury hotel. So if you tend to spend a lot of time lounging in your room on a vacation, then this probably isn't the right place for you. But if you just need a \"base-camp,\" then this is just fine.The room was nicely decorated with warm colors, and the furniture was nice. The bed was comfortable. The room was clean. It had a fridge, a safe, ironing board, and a coffee maker (single serve) with k-cups provided. The tv was  also just fine.  I had wireless coverage at all times with excellent connectivity.The breakfast is a buffet of fruit and pastries, cereal. Hot breakfast is available for a fee.  If you do go, bring the small lunch bag with you and load it up. Even if you don't eat it all in the morning, put it in the fridge for a late night snack. Seating is limited around the pool. Yes, you can take it to the beach, but it's a bit of a hassle.The bathroom, on the other hand, did reflect the hotel's age. Upgrades have clearly been limited in the bathrooms. It did have broken tiles  and a color that didn't match the rest of the bathroom.  BUT it was clean, served our needs, provided a hot shower with good water pressure and a newer \"throne.\"  Fancy? No. Acceptable? Yes.There are no chairs in the room. So when we DID spend any time in the room, our option was a small high table with 2 benches, a lawn chair on the balcony, or the bed.  Not a huge deal, but one level of discomfort.Valet parking only is dumb. But you will find that everywhere in the Waikiki area... Parking is very limited Ina condensed, busy tourist area.  Go to the Aston Banyon, about 2 blocks from hotel entrance and pay for a week of parking at $80. Cash. That worked great. Ideal? No, but we would leave in the morning, walk our 2 blocks, and be gone to other areas of the silane all day.  So,my ou learn to adjust. At least you're not waiting for someone to bring your car for you.The lobby is pleasant. Again,if you want luxury, go somewhere else and pay for it.Our only disappointment was even on 9th floor,new heard the constant traffic noise below us well into the night. It is a crowded, busy, tourist-heavy area, and the noise is a by-product of that.The beach is across the street. Nice beach area and great swimming in a protected area from the big surf.  Be prepared, however, for the homeless who take over the picnic areas.  This is a problem in the entire area, not just here.The zoo is nearby. Many restaurants in the area. The location of this hotel is it's best feature. It is 2 blocks from the bus, and if you do drive, finding and getting to roads out of town are easy. They were customer service oriented, except for the bell staff/valet group who were friendly until they realized we didn't use valet parking....My biggest complaint is the resort fee. Yes, I had good wireless internet. But the pool was under construction for our entire visit, and our fee should have been reduced fir that reason.  And we were charged a fee to use the safe! So, be aware, as you compare hotel costs, be sure to include whatever their resort fees are in your comparison. We felt this was a total ripoff.So don't expect total luxury. But this is a satisfactory hotel for the cost, compared to other options. So don't stay away just because of a few cosmetic issues. Overall, except for the fee, we thought it was just fine as a home-base. And we were there 2 weeks.Here's a tip: if you bring your floaties to the ABC store, they will blow it up for you for 60-cents."

Great views!  But there was trash under the couches, light bulbs in lamps did not match so dimming was spotty, the drapes in the living room did not open all the way, and - the worst - the furnace in the bedroom made a horrible, loud screeching sound all night so I could not sleep.  All this for $995 per night (plus $250 in taxes!), I think not.They thing that really peeves me is that I have let the hotel know of the problems I had but they have not responded.  Really?My advice, do not stay here."

        "review_text": "We enjoyed our stay at this wonderful hotel.  Our room was spacious and well appointed.  We also received an upgrade to a suite because we booked through American Express.  We almost never get upgraded let alone to a suite.  They also were able to honor an early check in for us as well.  Everyone from the front desk staff to housekeeping were great.  They had this adorable panda bear on the nightstand that you would put on your bed to have your linens changed if you wanted. I asked if I could buy a couple but they did not have any when I asked.  On the day we checked out they found 2 for me.  They were only $5.00.  I was expecting more like 10 or $15.00.The only thing I wish American Express was aware of is the rooftop terrace they list in their book is closed except for private functions.  We were expecting to be able to go up there for a view of the city and possibly have a drink.  I think they will let you up but only if it is not in use.  So there really is no access readily available.  Also their restaurant The Lafayette was below the standard of this hotel (see my review for that). I would not let that deter me staying here in the future.  I would just not eat there again.  Great location across from the White House."

        "review_text": "We took a very last minute trip to SF.  Went for the points on Virgin Air and used Hotel Tonight to book this room.  We wanted to stay in SF even though my family lives outside the city.  We also did not want to rent a car so the hotel needed to be near a BART/MUNI station (Powell Ste. in this case).  Hotel Zetta fit those requirements.  Parking by the way is $55 per night FYI.There were three of us, my wife and daughter.  We were trying to get a double queen but alas there were none available at check-in so we opted for a portable cot ($25 per night).  According to my daughter it was comfortable enough for our short stay.  The person who delivered the bed also gave us some extra towels.  That was a nice touch because I would've forgotten to ask.This hotel is part of the Viceroy franchise so the decorated portions of the lobby are familiar.  There's a doorman to greet you.They have a Beatles theme going on right now.  They also have a restaurant under the same roof called The Cavalier.  It's an English Pub.We checked into our room.  There were three things that were not working.  Our smoke alarm although working had become loose from the ceiling.  Since it was directly over our bed I picked up the phone to call the Front Desk.  Unfortunately, the phone didn't work.  The handset had not been placed on the receiver properly so the battery was out.  Not to worry, the speakerphone worked and we were able to call for help. We were going to head downstairs to eat so we wanted to put our valuables in the safe.  That too was not working.  Fortunately, our maintenance person was knocking on our door within minutes and was able to fix both the safe and smoke detector quickly.The king bed was OK.  Pillows were better.  View was horrible but it's what you would expect when you use a third party service to get a cheaper than normal room.  You get what you pay for.  Our room by the way was #307.  So anything on that side will be facing a brick courtyard FYI.Our WiFi was free because we booked it through Hotel Tonight.I will say this, it was quiet.  This hotel is on the corner of Market and 5th.  It's a zoo down on the street and we didn't hear a thing.  Maybe that's the advantage of that courtyard view.There's plenty to do in this area and having the Powell St Station right next door allows you the freedom of heading out each day to explore the city.  if you're trying to fulfill your SF bucket-list, the famous cable cars are right across Market.All in all, I would definitely go back to this hotel.  It was a great location especially if you're trying to take in the great city of San Francisco in three days."

        "review_text": "A friend and I, both 18 years of age, were granted the opportunity to stay at the Drake for two nights, complimentary of a family friend, while we were attending Lollapalooza. We checked into the Drake on the second day of Lollapalooza and should have known that our stay was going to head downhill from there. The family friend who got us the hotel room had previously paid numerous weeks in advance, and had the confirmation number to prove it. She generously paid for us to stay for two nights at this \u201cluxurious\u201d hotel. However, when we arrived and gave our information for a reservation for two nights, the concierge lady stated that we had yet to pay. We knew this wasn\u2019t the case and explained that a family friend had already paid, but the reservations lady said there was no record of that on the file. So, while in the hotel lobby, we called the family friend who then called the hotel to sort everything out.Once sorted out, we were given our room keys and headed up to our room, where we finished getting ready for day two of Lollapalooza. We returned that night and slept soundly.The next morning we woke up and got ready for day three of Lollapalooza. We ended up leaving the hotel at 12:30 pm to go get something to eat near the festival. We carried on with our day and listened to great music. At the end of the long day, we were excited to just go back to the hotel and sleep.Exhausted, we stepped into the elevator, exited onto our floor, walked to our room, and tried to key in, but our room keys no longer worked. We then tiredly walked to the concierge desk where we checked in the day before.I told the concierge man the situation with our keys and asked for a new one. Routinely he asked for our last name and room number. Once we told him this information, he gave a peculiar look at the computer screen, looked at us and stated, \u201cUm, you were checked you out this morning.\u201dI quickly responded, \u201cNo we didn\u2019t, none of us came down to check out.\u201dAnd he rudely replied, \u201cWell, you were checked out.\u201dI exclaimed, \u201cWe were given no information of a checkout time or checkout receipt of our stay.\u201dHe questioned, \u201cYou did not get an email?\u201d\u201cNo, we were given no information. The reservation we made was through a family friend, who paid for the stay. We never gave any email upon arrival,\u201d I proclaimed.He just looked at us baffled and was obviously not taking us seriously. I then asked, \u201cIf you checked us out, then where is all of our stuff?\u201dWith that he looked at me and stated, \u201cOh, your stuff was packed up and put in storage. The unfortunate part is that we have no open room tonight.\u201dSo not only did The Drake mess up our reservations on one of the busiest weekends in Chicago, but the hotel also touched all of our belonging and shoved them into our suitcases without notifying anyone! This is the most unprofessional action a hotel could perform, especially a hotel that is supposed to be upscale.We quickly called the friend who made the reservations and she wasted no time calling the hotel.Here we were, two eighteen year olds, stranded in a hotel lobby getting our stuff wheeled out to us on a bellhop cart. The concierge guy started calling other Hilton hotels in the area to try and find a room, but of course he had no luck.After about an hour in a hotel lobby, my friend called her brother who was an hour and a half away from Chicago to come pick us up. As he was getting ready to leave to get us, he called a friend from high school who attends DePaul University. Luckily she allowed us to come stay at her apartment for the night.The hotel, still on the phone with the family friend who was furious, paid for our cab fare. The two of us headed to DePaul in disbelief of the unprofessional treatment we had just received from The Drake. I will never stay at this hotel ever again. I could not believe how they treated us, and took advantage of us. I truly believe that they overbooked that night and decided to kick the youngest people, us eighteen year olds, out of the hotel.I have stayed at luxurious hotels in the past, which include The Greenbrier, The Inn and Bay Harbor, the JW Marriott Marco Island Beach Resort, and many more, but have never been treated with such disrespect. I recommend spending money elsewhere because this hotel is not worth the price, AT ALL."

        "review_text": "Just returned from a short stay.  The front desk made late check in very easy and streamlined.  Door staff was very attentive and ready to render assistance.The rooms are very spacious.  You do not feel closed in, yet lost in so much space.  The window bench a great value.  The bed is very comfortable.The hotel claims to be green-focused.  They are moving in a good direction with optional daily or every third day linen change.There are room to improve.  Daily towel changes for single occupants might not be necessary.  As with the linen, allow guests to hang up the towels if we are willing to reuse or drop in the tub if we wish a fresh set.  Having the ability to reset the AC, is helpful, but is the automatic setting at 65 really necessary?  Agreed that we experienced a wide array of weather (heat wave to thunder/lightning storm). This is San Francisco where the temperature is rather temperate."

        "review_text": "I usually always stay at one of the properties in CityCenter whenever I have to travel to Vegas for work (a lot). This was actually my first time staying at The Cosmo so I was very excited, but my experience was less than stellar. Here is my story:When I checked in, I did ask for a higher floor, and they offered to upgrade my standard two-queen bed room to king-bed terrace room for a fee. I agreed, thinking having the terrace would be a nice treat for myself. When I got to my room, I excitedly went to check out view. As I opened the door to step out on to the terrace, unexpectedly, a swarm of 15-20 huge moths sprung up from underneath the furniture, the walls, and corners of the terrace. When I say huge, I mean they were gigantic. I'm not talking about the innocent little white moths that fly towards lights at nighttime. These suckers were at least an inch long or bigger. They were so large they had visible patterns on their wings, like some ugly mutant butterflies that migrated over from Chernobyl. I didn't even know moths flew that high (52 stories up!), nor did I know they spent time outside during the day! If anyone else happened to be outside during my moment of attack, they definitely heard me scream. I immediately ran back in my room to safety. As I slid the sliding door closed,  I was greeted with a gust of wind and showered with dry, dead moth parts sprinkling over my head and on to the floor. These dead moths must have been lodged above in the track of the door and left to rain down on the next unsuspecting victim of the room (me). I was mortified. I absolutely knew this was not going to work and there's no way I was going to be able to enjoy the balcony I paid for.I immediately called housekeeping to clean up the limbs and wing bits on the carpet from the dead moth storm, and then proceeded to call guest services. I told them I didn't want the upgrade anymore and to just give me a room with a window and queen beds like I originally booked. They were incredibly hesitant in doing so, saying they were \"sold out\" of those rooms and that they would give me another king terrace room with \"less of a moth problem\". Trusting this, I moved to another room a few floors below.  I went to that terrace, and all I had to do was bang on the glass and surprise! More moths sprung up from all directions (this time I kept my door closed). I felt like I didn't want to be \"that person\" and complain yet again, especially when they apparently had no standard rooms available, so I bit my tongue and stayed in that room. Big mistake. Fast forward to 3am, I'm fast asleep since I have to be up early for a work meeting. I am suddenly woken up to a moth apparently stuck in my drapes, fluttering about, trying to get out. Not sure how it even got in my room. It was very unsettling and creepy and there was nothing I could do, but hope I didn\u2019t choke on a moth flying in my mouth as I slept.The next day, I go to the front desk. I explain all of the above and how I just want a normal room with no moths. The front desk employee admitted that I was not the only one to complain about them (apparently it\u2019s moth season?) and the only thing they could offer was moving me to another room again (finally a standard room this time) and not charging me for the upgrade fee that day only. That's not exactly fair, and I was not happy stuck paying for an upgrade I didn't even get to use that I was misled into buying in the first place (especially when I reported the moth issue immediately). Anyway, I moved rooms yet AGAIN, and while the standard room was finally moth free, I feel as though they brushed off the moth issue and gave me an attitude for moving rooms. At no point did I give the staff any attitude (maybe that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t care). But really, how can you blame me for not wanting to deal with creepy, large, nuisance moths?While the rooms were nice and I enjoyed my time at The Chelsea pool, the moth issue and non-caring attitude of the staff was disappointing. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be back."

        "review_text": "We stayed for just over a week in one of the tower suites.  The room rate was north of $1000 a night.  We were very surprised to see the way the hotel nickel and dimes you constantly.  The wifi is something scary like about $15 a day.  The gym has an additional charge of $15 a day.  The mini-bar is one of the new systems that registers the removal of items, but it hasn't been very well constructed, so when you slide out the drawer with the coffee machine in, mini-bar items fall over and even if you stand them back up, the hotel tries to charge you.  It is very rare these days for hotels to charge for wifi, and I've stayed in high-end hotels all over the world and did not expect an additional charge for the gym.The final straw that broke the camel's back was an incident that began a few days before our departure.  We were travelling around Napa valley when I received a text message from the hotel apologising for us being out when a room-service order was being delivered.  I texted back saying that we had not ordered anything and got a reply saying this was about the mini-bar and not to worry.  At checkout a $34.64 charge was on the bill for room service that we had not ordered that appeared to be this bill.  We complained, explaining we had never ordered anything, and eventually after considerable delay they removed the charge.  There was also another small charge that they removed after no-one could explain to me what it actually pertained to.  I figured everything was done, we paid for the incidentals on the bill and I got a folio printed which I fortunately hadn't thrown away when, 2 weeks later, with no notification from the hotel, I noticed an $18.62 charge turn up on my credit card.  I immediately phoned them and after a number of long holds they eventually came up with some story about this being an adjustment because the bill hadn't been fully closed on checkout.  Eventually after considerable discussion they agreed to cancel the charge.  If nothing else though, I could not believe they would charge my credit card 2 weeks after checkout without any comment or notification.It is clear the staff don't know how to use the payment system at the hotel.  The amount of time figuring out charges (both at checkout and 2 weeks later on the phone), and the wrong charges being applied to rooms demonstrates this."

        "review_text": "We recently stayed in this hotel for 7 days over New Year 2014. We were travelling with our two boys aged 14 and 9, so pre booked and paid ( or so we thought) two rooms inter connecting.  On check in we were hit with a resort charge of US$30 per room ( for what we still do not know ) and on top of that US$65 per room (total US$130) for inter-connecting facility. I was very angry that this was never communicated or stated in any terms or conditions. So with a room rate of US$500 per night plus $30 plus $120 Plus  room tax $23.56 plus Occupancy tax $46.25 the actual charge per room was in fact US$666.22 so a 33% mark up we had no idea about. Now if you add $60 for an umbrella each day without which its not really that comfortable on the beach ( and you have to book it the day prior or they book out, and if you book on the day it is $50) now that is for starters, on top of that is the tipping which ranges from 18% to 20%. Breakfast was around US$140 for 4 people, so another rip off and you compete for a table with people coming off the street for breakfast too, so no priority at all for hotel guests. The rooms are average and most are noisy either facing the street or the courtyard where the noise floats up. For New Year we decided to pre book the NY dinner so were offered two options 6:00pm or 8:30 so with kids took the 6:00pm option. Dinner was $500 and that did not include anything but food, not even a New Year's Eve glass of champagne - all that was extra. The meal was honestly terrible with things like 1 shrimp served on a bed of mash potato, 1 scallop in a mushroom broth, and the whole experience was a rip off. That dinner did not include any entry to the NY band playing in the forecourt we were ushered out as fast as possible by 8:00pm where we were offered the opportunity to join the festivities for a further $60 per head. The whole experience in Hawaii is a tourist trap where they have honed their skills in ripping you off at every turn. The highlight of our trip was Pearl Harbour tour, with an excellent narrator and a very moving tribute to those who perished. Besides this Pearl Harbour  trip I will not recommend this hotel ( service is impersonal and self entitled) and Hawaii after my second visit was an utter disappointment."

This is a great hangout! There\u2019s live music, good food or bar bites and the drinks are always flowing!There\u2019s also a Wolfgang Puck express restaurant below, or go around the corner towards Kapiolani Park and grab a burger at Lulu\u2019s or maybe a drink at Starbucks. If you\u2019re a smoothie person, Jamba Juice is there too!There are free towels for guests when using the pool, there is also an onsite gym and laundry services are available.Enjoy Waikiki- and enjoy your stay, I know I did! Aloha!:)"

        "review_text": "Where do I begin?  First off you will feel very uneasy walking to and from the Jockey Club from the strip or from the Cosmopolitan!  When walking from the strip you have to use an alleyway which is for cars and they have a pedestrian walk way but it is enclosed in chain link fencing which has tarps on the fence so you can\u2019t see through it, beware ladies as it is a prime location to be attacked and go un noticed! When coming from the cosmopolitan you come out of the elevators into an empty garage but you can cut through the back door of the NASTY convenient store located in the Jockey Club.The rooms are okay if you just plan to sleep and not shower!  The tub filled halfway with water every time we took a shower, I let the property manager know and she did apologize but her excuse was that it was time for them to do a drain blowout.  The elevator and hallways to rooms were absolutely FILTHY as well as the carpet in the room!We had maid service 2 of the 7 day stay because they did not get to our room during the day, we would come to our room around 5 and they were still several rooms down, come 5:30 housekeeping is over!  On the day of checkout I left a tip for the 2 days of service that we did receive, we left our room at 8am to get coffee and when we returned we could not find the tip anywhere!  I spoke to the front desk about this and she said that they typically start going around at 8am to retrieve their tips.  Maybe they should worry about getting rooms cleaned early and retrieve their tips after the guest has checked out.  I wish I had not tipped at all!Beware of the valet staff, we had another hotel guest in our personal vehicle and the valet staff responded with, \u201coh, I just gave him a ride to the garage and back\u201d, this is NOT acceptable in my book!Hotel staff is not friendly and is VERY rude upon your checkout, we requested assistance from the bellhop that was standing around in the valet area and he told me that I needed to get my own luggage cart from the front desk.  When I went to retrieve a luggage cart I had to leave my ID with the front desk, as if I\u2019m going to steal it.I saw many people doing the timeshare presentation and heard many of them say \u201cWELL, THAT WAS A WASTE OF TIME\u201d upon their exit.  I also came across several different salesmen with potential owners in the elevator and the salesman does not even waste their breath to tell a guest hello.  Duh, what kind of salesman are you?  Your potential owner will see that and think \u201cyou are being so friendly to me because you want me to buy but once I\u2019m an owner you won\u2019t even tell me hello?\u201dInterval should remove this place from their exchange, this is the WORST timeshare that I have ever been to!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The man at the check-in counter was very hospitable and helpful.On the downside:  the service is very mixed, the $15-per-day WiFi is slow, the \"nautical\" themed restaurant and bar is very mediocre but extremely expensive.  The bar offers a large menu of beers, a few of which are available.  Similarly, the rooms prominently feature a \"room service menu\" although the hotel has suspended room service.  There is often no person available to answer the \"guest services\" phone line.It's a very comfortable, old hotel.  It is not a high end hotel in all respects, even though it is priced as one.The location is excellent if you want to be near DuPont, Embassy Row, the red line metro, or the Phillips."

        "review_text": "This was my first stay at Four Queens (5/29 - 6/3).  I had read many positive reviews about this hotel, so I gave it shot and was not disappointed.  To start off, there was no line when I checked in, so it was quick and easy.  The clerk at the desk and ALL the other staff I came in contact with were very friendly and polite.  I called twice about minor issues, and someone came up promptly (the second call was late at 11:30pm).  I was on the 9th floor and was pleased that the hall and other guests were very quiet, and I didn't see one kid the whole time.  Also, the hall had a very pleasant smell, which was a nice touch.  I requested a nonsmoking room, away from Fremont Street, and I got one in the North Tower.  Yes, the rooms are quite dated and have seen better days, but they are fully functional, and everything was clean.  I had a king-size bed which was better than my own bed, and nice pillows too!  I slept great all five nights on those crisp, white sheets!  The bathroom is also dated and on the smaller side, but again, it is fully functional.  The shower had great water pressure, so no issues there.  There is a good-size closet with mirrored sliding doors, a flat-screen TV and a safe.  However, a mini-fridge would have been nice to have in the room...maybe a microwave oven as well.I ate at Magnolia's Restaurant (twice) and the Chicago Brewing Co., both of them on site.  The food was quite good and very reasonably priced.  Good and friendly service by the hosting and wait staff.  I did not play at the 4Q casino, as half of it was closed off due to some work being done.  I was told by the desk clerk that room renovations are planned to begin in the fall.  I hope so because those renovations are much needed so that the hotel can be competitive going forward.  I rented a car, so it was great to have free parking (for hotel guests only) and NO stupid resort fee!!!  The location can't be beat, right in the middle of Fremont Street, and there is a Tix-4-Tonight kiosk right on the premises.  I guess the only thing I didn't like too much was having to walk through the casino to the elevators for the North Tower when coming in from the parking garage.  Other than that, I really don't have any other dislikes.All in all, I had a very good and pleasant stay and would recommend the 4Q to anyone who is on a budget and wants a clean, decent room in a great Fremont location!  :-)"

        "review_text": "Please trust this unbiased review and do yourself a favor. Stay elsewhere.Pros: It's right on Fremont St., close to all your gambling needs. Casino in the hotel itself is just ok. The bar is well stocked. Nostalgic for sure.Cons: Small, outdated, unmaintained rooms with tiny bathrooms. Extremely loud from either side (trash alley on one and Fremont St on the other). Casino music was so loud a conversation couldn't be held easily. A/C in my room (the only room I have to base this on) worked somewhat... Never reached lower than 75 deg. Room service never knocked. She came in on me twice, once just after a shower, unclothed. One (not all) of the front desk workers was extremely rude and unprofessional. When I asked to speak to a manager, his reply was \"what's the problem?\" I asked 3 times to no avail and received the same response. Water temps in shower could not be regulated due to constant surging. Elevators are abnormally slow...hence the seat nearby I suppose. No refrigerator in the room, only a half-size ironing board, receptacles nearly non-existent for those of us who need bedside power (phones/sleep machines/etc.) No toiletries provided except shampoo/conditioner and hand soap. For the carefree, alcoholic gambler in need of a quick place to crash after a hard night of partying, this place is for you. To the average business man/woman who enjoys some gambling fun and a nice clean stay... Go elsewhere. I travel every day and stay in over 300 hotels per year and this makes my top five places to never stay again. Hope this was helpful. Have a blessed day!"

        "review_text": "Fremont hotel and casino has always been a place I wanted to stay when visiting Vegas  (I visit 3+ times a year) but after my recent encounter, I will never! We went for dinner at Tony Roma's but while waiting for our number to be called we figured we'd grab some drinks at the bar.  I decided to throw $20 into the machine at the bar and gamble for a \"free\" drink.  My friend opted to pay for hers.  While situating myself (I planned to stay relax, have a drink and gamble) I was setting up my game, putting my wallet back etc. The bartender came over and took my order, and I advised him I planned to stay for a bit if he wanted to wait for me to gamble enough to get a \"free\" drink. First spin.. $10 bet. He brought the drink back, slammed it on the counter and told me I better hurry up and gamble. Wait what?!  I told him that was pretty unprofessional and he started yelling at me.  Literally causing a scene and pointing at his boss (so he said) and telling me to take it up with him.  So I did.  And found out that wasn't his boss.  So now I've been embaressed and lied to.  They've now taken my drink away from me.  Uhh ok?  I pulled my money out and ask for the bar manager.  He was nice enough to apologize and seemed to have been quite upset with the employee.  But since I took the remainder of my money out of the machine, he took my drink and poured it down the sink.I work in a high end client based customer service environment...  So this type of service was appalling to me.  You should never have employees who yell at customers.  There is never an excuse for that.  As a manager, an apology is great, but that didn't fix the situation.  I would suggest Fremont provide some customer service training to their frontline employees. (The New Gold Standard Book by The Ritz Carlton Company is a great book with wonderful customer experience standards) They are the face of your business.  Enable your employees to make decisions and go above and beyond for customers to make a situation like this better.  Although this situation is minimal on the grand scale of things..  I would never ever stay here simply for fear that there was an issue with a room, a credit card charge etc.  What then?  Obviously the staff here are not trained properly in customer service.  Perhaps I've been spoiled with wonderful service at other Vegas resorts but I found this front line service unacceptable.  I visited on Saturday February 10th at approx 8pm"

        "review_text": "So here I am writing this on the first morning at my stay at the Royal Hawaiian. I've got to say that so far, I'm disappointed.We arrived late at night and it was dead quiet. Check in was fast. However we were given a room right near the elevator after being told we were being put in a quiet room. It is not quiet at all.  We weren't asked about it or advised.  So now I'd have to complain and asked to get switched. I just wish it would have been discussed at check in. When you're told it'll be a quiet room, one would assume it wouldn't be beside the elevator.We were told we've been upgraded.  But not from what to what. I booked a Deluxe King and that's the room I'm sitting in. It's a nice room but not sure where the upgrade is. Last I checked we're looking out on to the grounds. Why say that?We're given our room keys and WiFi password and sent on our way. Not one description of any of the available amenities.  Not even told where the elevators are. Maybe I'm being too picky but I've stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels and overall the service so far is not at that level.  Those are the basics.I'll update if any of the service level I've experienced so far changes. It's still early."

        "review_text": "Was this some sort of joke?  I'm still waiting for the camera people to come out and tell me it was practical joke the whole time.  Never again.  This Four Seasons is a joke.  The entire hotel would make a nice Westin, at four stars and about half of what they charged.The room we had was tiny and bland.  It overlooked a roof next door, super!  Now I did book through amex (which gives you upgrades when available) and tell them before hand it was our honeymoon but they still stuck us in the smallest lowest room in the hotel.  It was the same as any regular Hyatt or Westin, meaning terrible for a five star place.  When I reminded them it was honeymoon I was assured it was a good room.  Well if that's a good room this place has problems.Also, we ordered breakfast two mornings, both mornings they screwed up the order.  No apologies, nothing to make it right. If that wasn't enough, the bill was also messed up when we checked out, in the hotels favor, shocker.  I was going to complain again at check out but they didn't even bother to ask me how the stay was.  I called the number they provided to discuss the billing error and course nobody picked up.I really can't believe any of the good reviews, this place is a joke.  Oh and Wi-Fi not included for 700 dollars a night.The Four Seasons in Maui was perfection ---- this one ruins the brand name."

        "review_text": "We stayed in this hotel for our July 4 vacation. The hotel tries very hard to make sure their guests are happy. All of the employees were very nice and I guess we were on the side of the hotel without the train noise because I never heard it at night. The hotel pool is wonderful on the rooftop and the gym is exceptionally clean. I recommend this hotel without hesitation. I feel like my review would be more helpful if I gave you some tips for your stay.. First off, it was an easy train ride from the Reagan Airport. We bought a metro card that costs $10 that we were able to add funds to. The walk is less then 5 minutes to the hotel from the train station if you use the correct exit, we walked out the wrong exit once and we were completely lost. Ask someone to point you to the correct exit. There is a CVS drugstore next door that is overpriced and has very limited hours but we found very useful. There is also a McDonalds down the street. In addition to walking, we used Uber for the first time as our way to get around this city. It always took less than 5 minutes for them to get there and they were so much less expensive then a cab. I could not believe how easy it was. I loved the fact I did not need cash or have to worry about tipping. A restaurant that we walked about 15 minutes to was called Penn Quarter Sports Tavern. It was near the National Archives museum. The food there was very good. There is also a sandwich shop next door to it that was pretty good. We took an Uber to a pizza place called H&pizza ; we absolutely loved it. It is way too far to walk. They had a dessert pizza that was delicious. Perhaps it was because we visited the city during the July 4 holiday but we could not get into any restaurants we wanted to try. I would recommend making reservations before your trip because all the restaurants recommended on TripAdvisor were booked. This hotel is a perfect location for a visit on July 4. Unfortunately, right now most of the mall\u2019s grass area is under construction so seating was limited and crowded. The concert is in front of the Capitol, but we did not want to get there as early as recommended so we watched the fireworks by the Washington Monument.  I wish we had watched them in front of the Lincoln Memorial or in front of the capitol because the view would have been better. My family is not willing to sit somewhere more then an hour to wait for fireworks. If you do go by the Washington Monument, bring a shower curtain to sit on if the grass is damp. Food and drinks are not available, so bring them with you to make time pass faster. You can buy Big Bus and Old Towne Trolley tickets in the hotel gift shop. They were sold out so we could not use them. Call the hotel to buy them early if you are visiting during a busy time. We saw a lot more Big Bus\u2019 around when we were walking so I would have used them, if they had not been sold out. We ended up taking a direct metro train to Arlington and it was a short walk to the cemetery.  I hope these tips make your trip easier when you stay at this property."

        "review_text": "Thank god I did not stay in the hotel, however I used the spa facilities on the 24th of February at 18:30 and had the worst and most disgusting experience of my life. Once finished the treatment I was about to use the toilet and found not one, but TWO alive cockroaches on the seat.In the most calmed and civil way we told the receptionist about this unfortunate incident and she called the manager Suwanna Puangnak to inform her. My first surprise was when her feedback was \"I will call them tomorrow\" - thats it. We paid for the massage and 2 weeks after (out of courtesy I decided to give her some time) I am still waiting for that call, expecting a compensation.At this point I do not want any compensation, I just want to make sure the rest of Emirates Grand Spa clients like us know what they are dealing with - a spa full of cockroaches and careless managers.I am attaching 3 photos to confirm the above... I would have uploaded the video but its not compatible with this website.Regards and good luck."

        "review_text": "I took my girlfriend to Jumeirah Beach Hotel for her first ever visit to Dubai. I have been coming to Dubai for 10+ years now and always stayed in this hotel. I cannot over exaggerate just how bad a majority of the staff were on this trip, something which I have never seen before out there and have always told people how good service is. I booked the executive lounge as part of our stay as i normally have done in the past.I will begin with the good parts: La Parilla the steak restaurant on the 25th floor is and always has been one of the best parts about going to this hotel.Some staff were exceptional as you do expect from everyone however certain people deserve to be highlighted. Staff I would like to single out as very good are Imad Chidiac at the front desk doing his training for manager. Imad dealt with me frequently throughout the trip with regards to many issues we had with service and quality and overall seems to have sorted everything although I am still awaiting an email from him or a manager of some sort with regards to the holiday. The assistant manager of the restaurant Tortuga; Jorge, was another person that thankfully made some of the holiday enjoyable along with his waiter Rafael. A final person that should be pointed out is Mizan. Mizan is a buggy driver that for the final three days sorted us out with all our lifts and was punctual, friendly and couldn\u2019t be of any more help then what he was, exceptional.I would now like to go onto the quite awful parts of this holiday: Other then a few people who I have singled out, myself and my girlfriend were not spoken to correctly by any staff in any restaurant or hotel throughout the holiday. Key persons that had no customer service would be the manager of Dhow and Anchor, appalling service. After trying to book a table at his restaurant to be told you can\u2019t book but there will be a table guaranteed for us to arrive to and then be told there is no table when we do arrive, you will have to sit at the bar as he pointed to the seats at the bar, a space big enough for one person to maybe eat alone, not for a couple to eat together. For a three course meal on our first night we certainly won\u2019t be sitting at a bar for our meal, I am not in the UK in a local \u2018pub\u2019, I am sat in a \u20185-star\u2019 resort. Then the meals come, I may aswell have gone to a \u2018pub\u2019 and had a steak as it would have been nicer and had less fat in it. The manager then apologises not by saying anything but by placing another pint of cider in front of me. This is after the meal was finished and we want to go to bed, as you can imagine the drink was left there. Other then upon check in the people behind the reception desk were rude, in particular a man, Dipak, incredibly rude. When asking for a manager I was told by him he couldn\u2019t get me one so I asked where were they, the reply was simple: I cannot get any, ask over there (as he pointed across the lobby). Not good enough. It also amazes me that now after booking executive lounge you are still expected to stand and wait in queues to check in and out and you aren\u2019t taken to either of the executive lounges, sat down to receive a drink and check in comfortably as was always the case in the past. These are things you do expect when paying that much more, not to be checking in as you would for the normal room packages.An incident with a buggy driver, Barju (excuse spelling) was another clear let down of the hotel as he stopped at our buggy stop and told us we could not get picked up there and had to walk to our restaurant, making us late for our booking. A final manager that needs to have all her training redone or moved back into a waitress position was the manager of Pai Thai. Ainee Jehteh gave us the worst service I have ever received in my life in any hotel I have ever been to. Rude would be an understatement and for a restaurant people are expected to be paying roughly \u00a345 per person as a supplement this is certainly not what is expected. The night eating at Pai Thai was by far the worst night we had here after the buggy incident to start with and the the fiasco in the restaurant. The restaurant fiasco had started with my hotel ringing the restaurant to say I would be 5 minutes late, which we were, arriving at 5 past 9 for our booking at 9. We were then told our table wasn\u2019t ready. We sat in the lobby on a footstool big enough for 1 person between the two of us as it was so busy in the waiting area. We waiting until half past 9 when the table is finally ready; half an hour after our booking should have been there ready for us. Not even a drink or anything was offered to us. I can categorically say I will never return to the Pai Thai restaurant and advise anyone that does go there to expect nothing but the lowest standard service for your \u00a345 per person supplement. I would even though it was not open on this stay always recommend Zheng He\u2019s the Chinese cuisine restaurant as an exceptional restaurant from my past experiences. I would have eaten in Zheng He\u2019s instead of Pai Thai however it is shut for refurbishment which is not made clear online at all, and Pai Thai I was then told by the restaurant booking desk is the only Asian cuisine restaurant on offer that is not a buffet restaurant as we didn\u2019t want to have dinners in the buffets. The executive pool is very good however there is seemingly a happy hour 3-5 every afternoon which we were made aware of by another couple staying there. Not one person told us this and there is absolutely no sign or menu to tell you what\u2019s on it."

        "review_text": "Why would anyone stay here with all the other hotels?  First, this hotel does have character and panache. It is a very large hotel and there is always movement.  Even though there is a line in check-in, it does go fast with the friendly staff.  And, if you are thirsty, there is always free lemonade and or punch.There are plenty of comfortable chairs and tables in the lobby.  There is a nearby coffee shop, bar and restaurant. And, if you look closer, there is a collection of the famous Dale Chihuly glass on display in the lobby.The hotel is split into two towers: Pike and Union.  There are at least eight elevators in each tower that will quickly take you up or down. No time wasted at the elevators.On the 35th Floor of the Pike Tower is the 24 hour Fitness Center and inviting pool.  Just to go up to the 35th floor and seeing the sights is well worth the effort.Our room was clean and the beds extremely comfortable.  We were on the lower floor, but did have a view of a small park.We did get a decent rate booking through a third party.  But, this Sheraton is associated with SPG/Marriott awards program and people do use their points here.  The Club Level gives extra bonuses.  We were just in a regular room and loved it.We did drop off our party in front of the hotel.  There is a dedicated protected area, but it can get hectic.  Just have to be patient.  Luckily, I was turning in our car to Avis and did not have to pay the $57 daily parking charge.One of the major reasons for booking this hotel is the ease into a large city.  The famous Pike\u2019s Market is but five or so blocks away, fifteen minute walk maybe.  The Westlake Center is just a block away to get the light rail and Monorail.  There are many surrounding restaurants, too many to mention. So much to see and do.Would we stay here again?  Even though we stayed but one night, we received good vibes from this establishment.  We would not hesitate to book again.If you found this review \u201chelpful\u201d in any way, please press \u201cLIKE\u201d to let me know."

        "review_text": "Where to start so I'll try and set the context. I am a longtime road warrior. I stay on average about 300+ nights a year in hotels. I am lifetime Platinum for Marriott and started staying at IHG hotels a lot about 4 years ago. I've probably racked up 1000+ nights with them already. I've been a Spire (their top level) since the inception of the program.I am usually so busy traveling, that don't review as often as I might like. I often wait until I've been to a property a few times before reviewing. Often first impression aren't always accurate. Everyone can have an off day. However here I've had a chronic issue that I've decided to address. In the past at check in, they want you to present your original booking credit card. Keep in mind, they have it on file somewhere and if don't show, they'll still charge your room so they obviously have access to it.In the past there have been a few times when I stayed and I didn't have it at check in, so I used another card and told them expressly NOT to charge my room to that card and I'll give you the other card before checking out. Despite this they still ended up charging the other card anyway even though I gave them the original form of payment I booked the room with.Today I needed my wife to pick up something for me and gave her this card so she could pick up what I urgently needed. So at check in it became a big issue since they wanted the original card, which they already have the info for anyway, or to complete some long drawn out form to authorize them to charge the room as I didn't want to have a repeat of the issue I previously had where they ended up billing the wrong card anyway.So they wanted the complete card number, even though they have it on file, but this is a new card I just received so I don't have it memorized yet like my old one. Long story short it became a bigger hassle than it need be. I had to contact my wife, have her send a photo to me, then complete this long form to authorize the card. A total waste of time. Again, had I not shown, they would have charged this card anyway. So forewarned is fore armed. If you want to change payment options, make sure you watch them at the end run it against the card you want it charged against! It can take quite some time to get this corrected. Surprisingly enough, you don't need to complete one of these forms LATER to have the payment changed so why do you need one upfront???More about the hotel itself. Parking is a pain here. Better to cab, Uber or Lyft here. If you are trying to come in during the busier hours, there is only so much room to park and it is valet only. Valet is pretty common but the small area for you to pull into, means typically only 1 or 2 cars will fit while you check in. Several times I've had to wait on the street to try and get in. When you go to check out, make sure you call down in advance to get your car. They say 10 minutes but that is hopelessly optimistic. There is only room for a few cars up top to be waiting. Plan closer to 20 minutes but not so long that your car takes up space until you come out.The bar on top of the hotel has a nice view. This is probably the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself might have been more luxurious about 20-30 years ago. It is starting to look dated. It isn't as new and fresh inside as the JW nor old enough to feel stately with a sense of history. It is somewhere in the unhappy middle.Like a lot of older hotel, your electronic connectivity is sort of an afterthought. Case in point is the lack of outlets near the bed. Most people sleep near their phones as they use them like alarm clocks. No such luck here. On one side of the bed, no outlets other than behind the bed. On the other side, one of the outlets had a ground plug broken off in it. Speaking of alarm clock, they have the ones that connect to the OLD iPod connectors. Nothing newer with the lightning ports if you are using an iPhone 7 and the 3.5mm headphone jack won't work either since the latest iPhones don't support that. If you have an Android, you can still user your headphone jack.The beds are normally comfortable and pretty close to being on par with most Marriott and Hilton properties. Cleanliness is generally ok. Thankfully the climate control systems are super noisy. The products in the bathroom are very average, not like some high end hotels give you. Then again a lot of people bring their own stuff but I am limited to living out of a carryon for weeks at a time and with the TSA regs I find it easier to use what is in the hotel than dealing with a larger bottle that will last a week or two.If you want somehow to connect your laptop to a TV, look at some other hotel. Most of the more modern hotels have some sort of panel where you can connect to the TV. I don't recall a single room that has this even in the suites I've stayed in.This will likely be the last time I stay here. The other Intercontinental is a better choice in a lot of ways. This one is due for a makeover. Generally the staff has been good but honestly the best people I've dealt with are the valets and porters.One last thing to note, the hotel has some nice views depending on the floor you are on. Higher is typically better. Once you get about the 7th floor or up, it is good in most directions.I was going to be in SF for a week and had booked this for 1 night and planned to extend for more. Instead I'll go somewhere else. I don't know what it is but the IC hotels in the US are typically lacking compared to their Euro and Asian counterparts. I think they have an image issue. For high end, in the US, I think Marriott does it better though the Klimpton in SF is worth looking at. For the low end and mid-range, the Holiday Inn Express, Even and Staybridge are definitely the best. At least if you get a more modern Holiday Inn.The only plus I can see of this property over the other Intercontinental is possibly better location depending on where you need to go. Less homeless people in the immediate area. For me I'll cross this one off my list for this coming week and in the future. I'll probably go to the Klimpton or the other IC."

They didn\u2019t seem surprised or really even bothered with our situation. Further, they tried to imply WE didn\u2019t close the door correctly, which wasn\u2019t the case at all.PLEASE DONT EVER STAY HERE AND SPREAD THE WORD."

        "review_text": "The hotel has cock roaches. No, they don't tell you when you are checking in but if you have stayed there recently, CHECK YOUR CLOTHING AND EVERYTHING. We started noticing the roaches when we were driving around in our rental car. We had all our bags in the trunk. The room they put us in was outdated and it wasn't even worth the $295 that the hotel charged us for one night. They probably put us in the crappiest room they had because the room was awful."

        "review_text": "My husband and I wanted to have a great time in Vegas without breaking the bank, so we found the Grand Chateau at a pretty decent price, $528.27 for three nights. Honestly, not too bad for being pretty much on the strip.Now, I will say that our stay at this Marriott started off on a good note. Our flight got in pretty early in the morning on a Thursday, but check-in isn't usually until 4 pm. However, I called ahead of time and the concierge was able to prepare our room for us WAY early in advance which was fantastic.After that, our experience rapidly went downhill. We understood that the housekeeping staff didn't do a full scrub down every day of our stay - not a problem. But, our first night we found a large, watery red stain on our sheets (not of our own doing). Does housekeeping not change the sheets after every guest?My husband and I decided to write it off as an old stain - possibly not anything to worry about.However, we continued to have cleanliness issues the entire stay. Besides the mystery stain, our toilet got backed up three, sometimes four times a day! For the first couple days, we simply thought the issue was our fault and proceeded to plunge the toilet on our own - multiple times a day, mind you. Despite our efforts, the room started to smell, increasingly, like sewage.I'm not sure why the housekeeping staff didn't notice it during their daily visits - or do anything to try to rectify it.Finally, during the last night of our stay, the smell was so repugnant, my husband and me were unable to sleep. After several hours attempting to fall asleep, my husband decided to approach the front desk staff to fix our sewage problem.Turns out, the hotel knew that specific room was having sewage issues for the past couple weeks! Not once did they decide to 1) Warn us of the issue beforehand or 2) try to fix the issue during our stay when our room started to reek. If the hotel knew there was an issue, I can't understand why the housekeeping staff wouldn't inform anyone or try to fix it for us while we were out of the room.When it comes to sewage issues, this isn't just a sanitation issue, this becomes a health concern! I truly believe any guest has the right to know when something about the room could endanger their health.It was only when the smell became too obvious to ignore, that WE were obligated to fix it ourselves and approach the hotel staff. If you recall, this happened at three in the morning during our last night. We actually had a flight out that morning, so we had to leave at 6 am for the airport.While the hotel staff did send a plumber up to the room after my husband complained, I was still in the room trying to sleep. The hotel staff didn't call the room and warn me that someone was going to approach my door at 3 AM, so that in itself was disrespectful. However, the lack of concern, compassion, and customer service that followed was much, much worse.At this point, my husband was so livid that, not only were we not able to sleep in our room for our last night, but our own health was put at risk due to their own negligence and lack of concern for our safety. Especially, since they knew about the issue for the entire stay. The hotel staff said they could give us a new room for the night (an offer they should have made from the beginning of our stay since they knew about the sewage problem in the first place) but it was too little too late. We already had to leave the hotel in 2 hours for our flight, so why move all of our suitcases, toiletries, and other items to a completely different room, on a completely different floor?That is the opposite of accommodating.No, at this stage in our \"crappy\" experience, my husband and I wanted some type of compensation. Whether it was comping a whole night for the sleep we did not get, or even getting a discount on our next visit to a Marriott hotel. SOMETHING to say \"We're sorry for neglecting the sanitary conditions of your room and endangering your health all for the sake of not being bothered to go out of our way and help you.\"My husband spoke with Cameron, one of the managers, who said he couldn't do anything for us besides moving our room for two hours. My husband insisted he speak to someone else because, at this point, we were not being treated like hotel guests. We were being treated as an inconvenience, a number. We were not being treated like paying customers who deserve respect, compassion, and the kind of consideration that our $530.00 stay demanded!We spoke with Kevin, next, who told us that he would treat this as a \"learning experience\" for his \"future employees\" so that this doesn't happen again for \"future guests.\" But he also, can not compensate us or help make our experience better in anyway. Excuse me? Let me quote the Marriott Management Philosophy for you:\"How a unit looks, the way a department functions, how employees act, and what the customer receives are all a reflection of you, the manager; and Marriott's commitment to its customers. You must combine your sense of personal and professional pride with your leadership abilities to build a winning team that will Keep Units Clean and Attractive, Be Courteous and Helpful, and Provide the Best Products Possible!\"Kevin and Cameron, you failed on all fronts.I will never stay at another Marriott ever again."

        "review_text": "So this was my very first time on the west coast and I wanted to make sure we stayed in beautiful rooms with enough room to be able to work and still enjoy San Francisco.I am a Hilton Diamond Member so naturally I gravitate towards Hilton Hotels. The Parc 55 boasted of a Sunset Suite that looked to be breathtaking. Despite the poor reviews I thought,  maybe these people didn't book the nicest suites and that's why they didn't have the best experience. So 2 Sunset Suits booked and thousands of dollars later I urge you to believe the poor reviews.The location of this hotel could be beautiful if it weren't for all of the scary homeless people that are EVERYWHERE! I was treated with a full frontal view of a nude homeless man as soon as I arrived, 1 block from the hotel. I wanted to walk around but it just didn't feel safe, even with Bloomies right across the street I would not walk there at night if someone paid me! PS I am from the east coast and walk around Manhattan at midnight alone and I didn't feel safe here.The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and has a modern lobby. The restaurants are lacking and there is no room service which was a huge inconvenience seeing as driving and parking downtown is a nightmare and I was not going to walk anywhere for dinner. Check in was fine once someone decided to man the honors station because the line was long and only had 2 attendants checking people in.When I got to the room I do have to say it was beautiful and spacious. Bay view is a stretch as I had to walk into the bedroom and right up to the last window to see water and I never actually saw the sun set as the hotel is not high enough to see over all the other buildings. The bathroom was the best part of the room. There was a full bath and a half bath and the full had a lovely jetted tub that I used almost daily during my week long stay.The turn down service scared the living daylights out of me as I was asleep and all of a sudden heard someone in my room. I should have locked my door but I forgot and about jumped out of my skin twice before I started putting my do not disturb on the door.When I first arrived I noticed something stuck to my ceiling above my bed which I thought at first was a projector and it turned out housekeeping had missed a whole page print out of a picture of a little girl that the previous guest had taped to the ceiling. I received a myriad of excuses from housekeeping but not a satisfactory apology to me lying down and being face to face with a creepy picture of a child over my bed. i had dinner so I left housekeeping in my room to take the picture down. Strike One.Strike two-came each night with the sirens and fire trucks wailing every 15-20 min. I am assuming there is a great deal of crime occurring through out the night because the noise is incessant. How am I paying so much for a room that is not even sound proof?Strike Three-I was disappointed to find there was no room service offered so my companion and I tried the restaurant on two separate occasions. The wait staff was preoccupied and I had to flag them down on both occasions. They were out of chicken and kept forgetting 1 of the 3 things I ordered. This happened on both occasions bc I ordered the same thing. I ordered the chicken wings and fries to go on day one to avoid going out for dinner later on and when I went to have dinner I realized there were no fries and the chicken wing I ate cost me dearly as I was up the entire night vomiting from what I can only imagine was under cooked chicken.I loved my tub but it was not enough to compensate for my sleep or my appetite. I was so disappointed and disheartened at this trip. I am not looking forward to going back at the end of this month again but I have already booked our room at a different hotel. I was told to stay away from Union Square and stay in the Financial District-sound advice!"

It's also in a great location for walking the city and shopping.  Oh - did I mention that there is a Lulu Lemon just across the street!....this made me one happy girl.   Our room was a 1 bedroom suite....which was huge; a large entry area, then a wet bar & closet hallway that opened up to the living area that had a gas fireplace, balcony and flat screen t.v.    The bedroom had a very comfortable king bed and then another large closet area and huge bathroom with both a soaking tub and stand up shower.    The hotel does have a spa which was I didn't use it - it seemed a little worn and in need of repair.    We were in Chicago for business and didn't pick the hotel for it's spa so I wasn't too disappointed.      This is the hotel that I will stay at when I return to Chicago."

        "review_text": "The team did an amazing job with the Old Post Office Building... but the service does not match the five star facilities.THE DISAPPOINTING:- Bar service is very slow- Restaurant service (at BLT Prime) was terrible, and food was just okay.  Go to the original BLT Steak a few minutes away for a much better experience- Room on 8th floor was small, and we paid for a higher category.  The front desk said  that the higher the category, the smaller the room, because you pay more for the view.  I'd probably have preferred a larger room with a less grand view.  The view down Pennsylvania Ave. to the Capitol was spectacular, though.- We returned from a long day at Gettysburg to find our room had not been cleaned.  This is a huge pet peeve, and one I wouldn't expect at a five star hotel.  The room was then cleaned during turn down service, so it was fine when we returned after dinner.- An attendant refilling the minibar entered the room as she was knocking... this would have been quite awkward if we weren't dressed.- You expect things to be overpriced at DC's five star hotels, but the prices here are insane ($80 for valet!?!?)THE GOOD- The hotel has a fleet of beautiful SUVs that will take you anywhere in DC.- Views and facilities are beautiful- Staff is friendlyAll in all, if the hotel brings its service standard up to the level of its facilities, it will be one of DC's best hotels.  Right now, it's got A LOT of work ahead to hit that mark."

Check in and parking was a breeze. The room was amazing! You walk into an open floor with a dining room, living room, and kitchen. Outside the living room is a balcony with a washer and dryer through a door to the left. Our bedroom had a huge walk in closet, big bed, and the master bathroom off to the right. The rooms were super cold just how I like it. The resort has 5 pools for you to choose from, some with hot tubs. The only negative is that I don't think the pools are cleaned very often. Both the pools and the hot tubs had a large amount of little dead bugs floating around.The location is excellent. Close 5-10 minute walk to the strip but far enough that it is not loud at the resort.Front desk staff was very kind and pleasant. Housekeeping kept to themselves. Not sure what those guys on the carts do because they always seemed be hanging around shooting the breeze, haha.Overall, I will definitely come back next time I am in Vegas."

        "review_text": "Having stayed at other Outrigger properties in the past, we did not hesitate to book Outrigger Reef. It has been a disappointment right from the start. As Discovery members, we were told to stand at the express check in area when we arrived for check in. We stood here for a long time while we watched everyone else be served around us. After 20 minutes and after seeing people arriving after us and being checked in first, I spoke up and asked to be checked in. We were originally told to join another line but then the receptionist realised we were discovery members and checked us in. Sadly our experience has not really improved from there. This afternoon we went to the shorebird restaurant and bar area to have a couple of drinks. The male waiter was very rude when we asked to sit at a table and told us that if we must sit there we can but he would have to wipe it over. He then proceeded to slam all of the condiments on the table and wiped it over without even taking an order. The staff in here seem to busy to talk to each other instead of worrying about the customers. Twice now we have asked to make reservations in the Shore Bird restaurant for dinner and have been told on both occasions that they don't take reservations and that it is a first in first served basis. Tonight we arrived for dinner (unreserved) to see at least 20 vacant tables but were told it would be a 40 minute wait. When we asked about all of the vacant tables, we were told that they were reserved for people with reservations. We instantly complained and said that we were told that you could not make reservations, only to be told that some reservations are allowed but not many. This is very wrong. What determines who can reserve and who can't. Also the housekeeping is very varied. Yesterday when we left our tip on the pillow our room was lovely and clean when we returned, however today as we had a very early start to trip to Pearl Harbour, we forgot to leave our tip. Our room was very ordinary when we returned and our coffee cups were not even cleaned. We have another week at Outrigger and we certainly hope that it improves greatly so that I can change my review, however at this stage I can not recommend it and would not stay here again."

        "review_text": "Having never stayed at the Parc 55 Hotel before, I was a bit skeptical.  The fact that it is part of the Hilton family hotels was the marketing point for me.This hotel is very conveniently located.  It is a 2 minute walk to the BART/MUNI TRANSIT STATION.  Since it was $62 a day to park, I was glad to have been using the public transportation system.The hotel is fairly secure, as the registration is located on the 2nd floor.  The Bell Desk and 24 security personnel are on the main entry floor.I arrived early, so the hotel was not prepared for my arrival.  They offered to allow me to store my bags, and they asked for my cell phone number to alert me when my room was available.After a few hours I received a text letting me know my room was available.Checking in was smooth.  The desk personnel (Cristina) made me feel   They use RFI room keys.  The elevators are a bit strange to me.  You press the floor you want to go to...and the keypad display tells you which elevator to go to.  Once in the elevator there are NO BUTTONS to press.  The elevator goes to the floor you have designated.  They are fast and efficient.My room was on the 20th floor facing EAST.  A very nice view room.  It seemed to be a relatively newly renovated room.  Very clean, and it had very nice furnishings.  Additionally it had a small refrigerator, and room safe.I had read that the City noises can be pretty bad (from the reviews I read.  I did not have a problem though...as there are always noises in a big city.The bed was comfy.  The closet was roomy.  I did not turn on the TV, but it seemed decent for the room size.I elected the Sunday morning breakfast/brunch.  Many times hotel breakfast can be pretty so so.  Because I chose the full breakfast, I was overwhelmed with all the options!  I opted for steel cut oatmeal, fresh salmon, and chicken congee.  There was all sorts of other more standard breakfast food.  I am a buffet person...and I was exceedingly pleased with the quality/quality of the food.  The price included the standard juice/coffee/tea.  The staff was very busy the whole time.  They kept an eye on me.  Breakfast ended at 1030am, but the staff did not seem to mind the remaining diners to relax in the restaurant.  It was totally relaxing to enjoy my tea and newspaper.I did notice a constant stream of people lined up to check out.  I was quite satisfied with the email .pdf sent to me.  No need to stand in a line.I have stayed before at the Hilton (located on O'Farrell).  That hotel has a really nice heated pool...which I missed at this hotel, but for this trip everything was fine.The staff were cordial, professional, and very efficient at their jobs.There are so many choices for hotels in San Francisco.  Because this hotel is literally 2 minutes away from the Powell Street Station, I will choose to stay here again.If you are not already aware, the BART TRAIN will take you direct to SFO airport.  It cost $8.95 and 30 minutes of your time to get to the airport.  Does not get any easier than that!"

        "review_text": "We were so disappointed by this hotel. It looked so beautiful on the website - great design and slick. We were excited to stay here and super let down. We arrived to a reception where staff seemed to busy to acknowledge us. We were checked in and shown to our rooms which absolutely stank of damp. Both rooms were as bad as each other. We asked to change and housekeeping were sent to clean the bathroom (which didn't smell). We repeated our request to change rooms, explaining the damp was coming from the bedroom and it wasn't until 2 hours later (and 12 hours of travelling) that we got a call saying we could move, by which point we were too tired and fed up. The staff were fairly cold and didn't seem very gracious. The pool was miles away from our rooms and we weren't shown were anything was, only that it was on the ground floor and to follow the signs. We would have to walk the entire way through the hotel, and into the outer parts of the grounds to reach it in a dressing gown or change which just didn't feel very luxury. The hotel looks super trendy and cool, but in reality it felt cold and soulless. We wouldn't recommend."

        "review_text": "We stayed at Outrigger Reef for 11 days and they were Fabulous.  The resort is modern and very comfortable, a nice relaxed pace and great amenities.  The location close to the Beach Walk and \"Rodeo Drive\" Waikiki was excellent and made getting out to a variety of restaurants and night life quite easy.  The Kani Kai Pila Grille made the best Mai Tai's (Happy Hour!!) and the fish and chips was tasty and huge ( two can share it!)  The Shorebird is here as well, and it had lots of energy and the sunset views amazing. Starbucks in the lobby was an added treat as well!  The Enterprise car rental in the lower level was very convenient, and Nicole at the desk a excellent representative.The best part of the Outrigger Reef resort though was the staff.  AlohaLani, Frank, Flo and Stanley were always gracious and helpful and smiling!!  They are incredibly committed to guest service, I found out Outrigger staff have long careers with the company because it is a great place to work...and it shows the warmth and helpfulness of the team there.  They all score 12 out of 10 in my book.The rooms are very nice ( the housekeeping staff are very friendly and accommodating), we had an ocean front and it had a fridge for snacks and beer as well as a nice big screen tv and a very comfy bed.  The actual beach is very nice, close to lots of activity shops, snacks and a few beachfront bars.  The kids that were in the beach had a great time!!Overall a great place to relax, eat, swim and enjoy all that Waikiki offers!  We are so pleased with the place we are sending my wife's parents there for their 60th wedding anniversary!!  We know they will love the place and the pampering you get there!  We are already planning our next trip back."

        "review_text": "I stayed at The Ivy on 7/25/15.   Myself, along with two friends, stayed in room 201.  When we entered our room, we were hit with a very strong sewer smell.  It was VERY strong.  The gentleman assisting us with our bags even commented on it.   I called down to the front desk to find out what could be done.  They were not interested in checking out the smell or looking into it.   I went down to discuss with the front desk and was told that it 1.) Was not a problem for the individuals who stayed in the room before us 2.) The hotel was booked up and the only other option was to find a new hotelI went upstairs to discuss with my friends and we decided that we would take the \"other hotel\" option.   The gal called up to the room and stated \"She already looked and nothing was available, unless we wanted to stay near O'hare\" (Of course not, that is not what we came for, also, we live in the suburbs and were here so that we didn't have to drive home after attending a festival).   She also stated that the best they could do was give us free breakfast.  My reply was \"No Thanks\" (not eating with that smell).Later in the night, we realized that our TV did not work.  A gentleman came up to help and IMMEDIATELY commented \"hats off to you for being able to deal with this smell\".  Very upsetting.  TV was fixed and we were left to enjoy the smell of backed up sewage.We just had so many issues.   I was told when I checked in that they would put an additional $250 hold on my American Express (additional to the room charge of $360 for the night).  They ended up putting two holds - one for $598.04 and one for $609.68.  They held over $1200 on my AMEX.When I checked out, I tried to get the name of the Manager who was on duty the previous night.  I was promptly told that there was no Manager.I will not stay or recommend this hotel to anyone.  I live in a suburb of Chicago, work at a pharmacy near the city, my husband works for a law firm in the city and we will steer people away from this hotel.   Terrible, terrible service."

        "review_text": "We stayed here for my wife's 50th birthday and our Silver Wedding anniversary. This is an exceptional hotel. Upon arrival we were informed that out room had been upgraded as it was our anniversary. Upon entering the room, not only did we have a view of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge, but there was also a complimentary bottle of wine for my wife's birthday. Beautiful room, super-comfy bed! Quiet at night, so great night's sleep! Great breakfast and very helpful concierge. Great location for exploring the city with a cable car terminal right at the side of the hotel on Hyde Street - tip: get there early (about 8-9am) to avoid the queue/line."

        "review_text": "I don\u2019t usually complete these with negative reviews as I am generally a really easy customer to please, but the Palms really pulled a horrible stunt so I had to share to warn people who are thinking about staying there\u2026Stayed at the Palms Resort with 5 friends for a bachelor party the weekend of 9/20/19-9/23/19.  We arrived at the Palms, and to our surprise, they informed us that a voluntary decision was made to close the Kaos day-club pool just a few days prior to our arrival. Given that this was a key amenity and a main reason why we booked at the Palms, which is off the strip, we did what any normal, reasonable guest would do\u2026we asked for a very modest refund, or at the very least, a small amount of comps to use at the hotel in the form of a dining credit.  We paid several thousand dollars for the rooms, and would have been satisfied with just a small fraction of that in comps\u2026we thought that was more than fair.The Palms management staff was completely unreasonable in this request.  They told us that they would not provide any sort of refund, nor would they provide any type of comp for dining, etc. So at the end of the day, the hotel advertises the Kaos pool as part of their amenities to us (which is one of the major reasons we booked), then VOLUNTARILY closes the pool immediately prior to our arrival. They provided us with ZERO advanced notice that the Kaos pool was closed, and when we asked for a modest refund or comp, provided us with NOTHING. They argued that another pool was still open within the resort and available to guests.  This pool, the Palms Place pool, is located about a mile away from our hotel room (Kaos is about 30 feet away), is significantly smaller, did not have a DJ, and is not even close to the same at the Kaos day-club pool.My advice would be to stay somewhere else.  If Palms is willing to, in my opinion, falsely advertise amenities to guests, then provide no advanced notice that they are closed prior to the guests\u2019 arrival, they could easily do it again. Don\u2019t put yourself in that position where they can screw you\u2026.just book somewhere else.  It really put a damper on the whole weekend when they not only told us that the pool was closed, but that they also wouldn\u2019t provide us with any sort of refund/comp as a gesture of regret or good faith.Buyers Beware\u2026better off staying somewhere else!"

        "review_text": "I am a Marriott Gold Member and received an offer from Marriott Vacation Club to spend 3 nights at this hotel for $199. We agreed to attend the 90 minute sales presentation. We booked an additional (4th) night at regular rates. We also paid additional money on top of the three night \"sales promotion\" rate to upgrade our room.The hotel was very good, clean and with good service. However, the sales presentation was a terrible reflection on Marriott as it was totally unprofessional and damaged the Marriott reputation.We arrived for the presentation on time but the sales rep was, at least, 10 minutes late. He didn't introduce himself and immediately went into a 10 minute monologue of his medical issues. He asked no questions to understand what I was interested in, or my level of interest ( I was quite interested and was actually a decent sales prospect). He somehow thought I would scratch out a check for $50,000 if he just wrote some numbers on a sheet of paper. I asked for a brochure or some written information. He didn't have any but if I wrote a check for $50,000, apparently I could meet Celine Dion (Really).There was no information that would enable a reasonably prudent individual to even do  a rudimentary cost-benefit analysis. His value proposition was to try and show me that I would realize big savings because if I tried to book a room at certain Marriott properties, (eg Aruba) I would have to pay in excess of $700/night (unless I was a member). Really? I have never paid over $700 for a Marriott Hotel Room.When I said I couldn't write a check for $50,000 without some form of written information, sample agreement etc., he asked me and my wife to stay put while he left the room. A few minutes later another person walked in (the closer?) to work me over. Maybe $30,000 would be more in line with my budget? I repeated that I, at least, needed something in writing to explain what I was buying. The \"closer\" couldn't provide anything but asked my wife and I to stay while the closer left the room. We were then ushered in to meet someone who tried to sell us on another 3-night package deal. Sorry!My wife and I left feeling in need of a shower. Totally unprofessional, high pressure sales, reminiscent of the old used car sales days.To rub salt in the wound, despite paying $199 and an additional amount for a room upgrade, the stay is not eligible for a 3 night credit (because \"I booked through a third party like Expedia, Travelocity...\" . Not true I booked through Marriott).The silver lining was that it was probably good to learn about the unprofessionalism of the Marriott Vacation Club product, before we got too far into the process. Lesson learned!"

        "review_text": "Stayed at this property a few weeks ago.  To sum it up, if you are a traveler with no loyalty to a program or no elite status you will enjoy the property.  It is a nice property with friendly staff in a super convenient location.  Just beware as they do charge an exorbitant resort fee without providing any resort amenities.  I know many complain about resort fees, but I don\u2019t have a problem with them when they actually give you something worth the fee like beach chairs/umbrellas like many beach properties do. At this place nope. The resort fee gives you free shaved ice and a fruit basket to pick out of. Total scam. Honestly best to avoid this place.If you are a platinum member expecting any of your benefits to be honored, you should avoid this place as it is obvious the management does everything they can to skirt around the member benefits. As a platinum premier, I wasn\u2019t even offered an upgraded room (which as a platinum is GUARANTEED IF AVAILABLE) at check in when there was virtually every suite type available for the length of my stay. Executive level, junior suite, family suite, and corner suites. When I mentioned this, their excuse was that they we\u2019re not available for upgrade. If they don\u2019t intend to honor the program then why even bother branding as a Marriott? The manager was hostile when and claimed the site has a glitch showing those rooms which was nonsense because later in the evening I overheard people checking in being offered a suite for a fee to upgrade. Totally shady business practices. What\u2019s even worse is they sell executives level rooms when there\u2019s is not even a lounge. They have a pantry basically offering room tempurate water and coffee and that\u2019s about it.  I spend a lot of money at Marriott/SPG properties with the promise of being granted certain benefits in return (when they are available). Being lied to, to avoid granting those benefits is not only frustrating, but leaves a black mark on the program. Total scam management running this property."

        "review_text": "On a whim we snagged this room on Priceline's \"name your own price\" feature. We got it for about $100 less than sticker price, which was very cool, but we figured we would get the \"priceline customer\" room, right? NOT the case - I am pretty sure, in fact, that every room at this hotel is equally as amazing. We don't do 5 star, EVER, so I am not sure what the expectation should be but the rooms STARTED on the 38th floor, and we had the most AMAAAAZING VIEW!! Birds flying BELOW us, we could see the Golden Gate and Bay Bridge, all the way to the end of the city. Just so amazing. We had a tub AND shower (I totally took a bath, sorry California), a couch and sitting area, a King bed with a VERY comfy mattress, that view, OH, and the windows cracked open! Not so much that you felt like you could fall out of course, but enough to feel that 5-star 38th floor breeze. The staff was super cool to boot, and the checkout was at noon.SO, If you are looking to splurge for the night, I would definitely recommend this place. We actually skipped doing anything after dinner so we could get back and enjoy the room."

        "review_text": "This was a mixed bag for us.  We planned a very special 5 night  trip with our children and grandchildren for Thanksgiving.  Seeing them is something that happens very rarely so it was a big deal for us.  I will start with what works and get to what doesn\u2019t.First off, the Hotel itself is very nice.  I would recommend the location very highly.  For any of you concerned it is too isolated,  I would advise that getting to Waikiki or shopping or Diamond Head is very convenient.  We did go down to Waikiki and I have to say it was crowded and dirty. There was trash on the beach which was really a small strip with wall to wall people.  The small beach strip is lined with hotels and entertainment and very noisy and active and so far from Hawaii that I\u2019m not sure I understand the appeal.We had ages 1, 3 and 7 years, 20\u2019s, 30\u2019s, 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s.  My main concern was whether it would work for all of use.  It absolutely did.  The beach is gorgeous, CLEAN, well maintained and even booked to capacity, it never felt crowded.  Gentle warm waves and plenty of lounge chairs and towels.   Activities for everyone to do.  Perhaps not the best snorkeling but that is available a short distance away.The pool was a surprise. I was worried about there only being the one, but plenty of chairs, never too full and great for both children and adults. They sell floats, rafts, balls, including small floatie for 1 year old at very reasonable price which was a pleasant surprise. I bought a great variety which made more fun for all the ages!  We simply left it behind for others to enjoy.  Prices for floaties, tubes and raft was from $4 to $11,I arranged for double umbrella stroller, car seats, pick up with concierge effortlessly before the trip.  Our daughter requested double baby jogger for the early morning time change so she could run.  For that, I went through a private service BabyQuip Quality Partner Ashlee Westmoreland (808) 868-5040.  She was incredible. She actually delivered the jogger late in the day so our daughter would have it for the first morning. She is really a special person.Our four rooms were beautiful and nice size in the tower.  We arranged for a suite for our daughter and son in law that have the 1 and 3 year old.  The suites are definitely well appointed and perfect for families with small children.  We had a regular king ocean view and loved it.  Very updated and in great condition.  Toto toilets (bidets) are in all categories of tower rooms \u2013 not sure about the other rooms.  The other two rooms were same quality and consistency.Important note - I am a super light sleeper. I was a little concerned about the location of our room - beautiful view but by laundry and cleaning station. Once the door was shut - you can't hear a thing. No noise from above, below, sides or outside.  I slept so well there.Views are very personal but I would definitely specify what you want.  One of the room was a partial and it overlooked the parking lot.  I think this is a communication responsibility.  We checked in early so we were able to move our rooms with ease within the category.  The front desk staff was super accommodating.Spa was out of this World.  Super nice surprise.  Excellent therapist \u2013 facials and massage.  Wendy was my massage therapist. I can\u2019t say enough about how wonderful she was \u2013 her warmth, professionalism and skill level was superb.  I wanted deep tissue but desperately needed some relaxation and received it \u2013 I felt like I was in a trance when it was over.FOOD \u2013Vertanda Afternoon Tea is amazing. A local friend suggested it and met us for Tea.  My daughter and her friend joined. It was wonderful. We sat on the patio and had delicious delicate sandwiches, smoked salmon, chicken, cucumber.  The pastries were ridiculously incredible.  Tiny versions of the best of the best.  We had a glass of champagne, enjoyed the overhand and breeze and could see the pool and the little ones having fun with their parents and grandpa!Hoku\u2019s \u2013 food is on a different level.  Impressive and well prepared.  Absolutely no complaints.  IT is expensive and the service is slow, but the servers are so pleasant, knowledgeable and attentive.  We were impressed.Cons \u2013Housekeeping is not an automatic.  It is very well done and rooms are really cleaned well and lot of nice touches.  My comment is when you leave for a few hours or down at the pool, just call housekeeping or let one of them know if they are outside the rooms that you would like your room done.  We came back from long day to messy room the first day, but this was taken care of after we became proactive.Seaside Grill \u2013 super slow, super stressed and food is downright bad except for the fries.  Really nice hostess and servers. They obviously don\u2019t get the support they need.  I don\u2019t have enough information to know why the food is so bad.PLUMERIA RESTAURANT is really the weak link here.  The food is so-so and the service is abysmal. Breakfast brunch isn\u2019t great.  It\u2019s not thought out carefully. One day fish special and other vegetarian or poultry option, rest of time literally entire hot area was nothing but pork.  Pork bun special and then down the line, two types of pork sausages, bacon, ham.  A distrubtion would have been nice.  Omelet station often had only one person and was over burdened with very long line. Most people would give up.  When they had two people it was comparable to other luxury hotels \u2013 a wait but doable so you\u2019re not eating alone if the rest of your party isn\u2019t waiting with you.Stations get messy and run out of items often \u2013 really often.Ala carte orders during brunch \u2013 won\u2019t get there until you are almost done \u2013 doesn\u2019t work well with an already over taxed system.We had a meal with all the family and sole purpose of this trip was for us to spend together as a family. We were seated at 6PM and ended getting appetizers and then waited over an 1.5 hourswith no service whatsoever. No water refills, no drink replenishment and our dirty plates left stacked on the table. Every once in awhile, our server would breeze by and say our meal was coming out shortly.  Needless to say, the children got very antsy and after 1.5 hours and several complaints, we ended up leaving. We had no choice. The 1 and 3 year old was done for the night and it was their bedtime.Explanation \u2013 there were several functions and the kitchen was over burdened.  Why they didn\u2019t close the restaurant is very odd and makes zero sense.  In other words, it wasn\u2019t there fault!  There was a wedding reception and another party going on in the Hotel.  Our observation was there was receptions almost daily and we received terrible service as a rule.  Why is this okay?  There are few things I dislike more than excuses when paying for service.  This is an expensive venue, so ignoring our tables for 1.5 hours down to no water, no drinks, no clean up of messy appetizer dishes is up there with Plumeria being the worse dining experience we\u2019ve head.  We had to ask that the dinner would be delivered upstairs to the rooms.  So, our last dinner together wasn\u2019t together but stressful, messy, upsetting and everyone was in their respective rooms instead of enjoying time together. Our son and daughter were struggling with little children that needed to have baths and get to bed. Needless to say, dinner was cold and inedible.Management \u2013 dining manager was apologetic, hotel manager apologetic but that was about it.  Horrible last experience.  Really made us sad and so disappointed.  It\u2019ll be two years before we are together for the Holidays.Can\u2019t really make that right.  Didn't hear a word from the Resort - nothing!"

        "review_text": "During our business trip to Bangkok this time, we stayed at The Berkeley Hotel, Pratunam and it was a pleasant experience.Things I loved about the hotel:Location: Conveniently located in the center of Bangkok\u2019s shopping district, the Berkeley Hotel is perfect for shopaholics who want to splurge non-stop! Bangkok\u2019s popular malls and night-markets are just a stone\u2019s throw away from this hotel. In addition to the shopping centers there are spas, massage centers, restaurants, BTS (train) below the hotel and/or in the neighborhood. You can find cabs outside the hotel. There is also a 7/11 right outside in case you need to recharge your phone or buy last minute necessities. You can also enter the Palladium World Shopping Mall from inside the hotel itself.Rooms: We booked two rooms, one in the Main tower and the other in the North Tower. Both rooms were clean and well-serviced. The bathroom in the North Tower room did not have a bathtub but the shower was good too.Swimming pool: The pool on the 11th floor was very cool with its transparent wall on the outer side. They also had a fun playlist of the latest english songs which added to the summer vibes and poolside ambience.Dining areas: There are two dining areas, a smaller on in the North Tower and a bigger one on the 10th floor of the Main Tower. The dining area in the Main Tower was huge and had ample space for everyone. The servers were prompt and courteous.Breakfast buffet: The buffet\u00a0had a large assortment of food. I liked that they changed the selections every day. For me the highlight was the cr\u00eapes. With many options for toppings such as chocolate, strawberry, honey, the cr\u00eapes were thin and delicious.Room views: The rooms offer very good city views and on clear days you can see\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bangkok city in all its glory.Check-in/Check-out: The process was very quick and the waiting area is beautiful and comfortable.Things they could improve:1. There were only two varieties of cheese at the breakfast buffet in the form of slices. A more diverse cheese platter with cheese chunks would have been great!2. Thailand being a fruit heaven for fruit lovers, the breakfast buffet was missing fresh fruit juice. They did have package juice which I am not a fan of.3.The rooms had only two power sockets at the table (the lamp plugged into one) and one by the bedside. Keeping in mind today\u2019s tech generation who use a lot of devices such as computers, tablets, watches, cameras and phones, a few more power sockets in the room would have been helpful. My husband and I had to take turns with our gadgets so we couldn\u2019t get them fully charged up.Although the hotel does have some room for improvement, overall we had an enjoyable stay and a satisfactory experience."

        "review_text": "Very Clean hotel with comfortable beds and pillows.  The staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  Forgot it had a pool and didn't bring our bathing suits.  They do have valet parking with in and out service which runs about $30 a night including tax.  The have a breakfast counter  which serves Starbucks coffee.  Close to the Metro.  The neighborhood seems safe to walk around and if you are in good shape you can walk to the Capital and the Mall.  The only complaint in my mind which kept it from getting 5 stars is the flimsy plastic glasses for water and paper cups for in room coffee.  Hard to make a decent late afternoon cocktail when the \"glass\" collapses in your hand.  I understand for sanitary reasons why they have gone to disposables, but a hard plastic glass and a hard plastic coffee cup would be welcome.  Also, there is no complimentary coffee or Danish in the lobby for breakfast.  Most of the Hyatt's we have stayed at do offer this.  However, these are small inconveniences and would certainly stay there again on my next trip to DC."

        "review_text": "The Royal Hawaiian has an excellent spot on the beach and the common areas of the hotel are lovely, but the resort is tired and is not at all living up to its 5 star reputation.Regarding the food, the breakfast food was not even a step above a Residence Inn--poor selection of fruit, grocery store sandwich bread and pastries, mediocre egg selection, and lukewarm coffee. The lunch menu was limited as well. In addition, the hotel did not have adequate staff. There were long waits to get seated, to get your order taken, to get served, and to pay the check.Pool service was nonexistent. And the single cooler of fresh water available for guests was filthy, with visible dirt on the spigot and on the paper cups beside it. Often, there were no fresh towels after 3pm. It is not clear that the pool and hot tub were ever cleaned during our 10 day stay. At 7 in the morning, the hot tub and pool were both full of sand.The building is old and has not been renovated. The bathrooms are tiny with no counter space and no lighting. The furniture in the suite we had was old and dirty. The maids, although friendly, had not been properly trained. They failed to leave toilet paper, the proper number of towels, and shampoo, when clearly needed.This hotel is resting on its laurels, but its time has clearly passed. Our stay was definitely a disappointment."

Firstly we sat for ages with bird crap on the table and that's ok but waited forever to actually get assistance. Eventually had our order taken then the first lot of drinks arrived and waited 30-40 minutes for two beers which arrived after asking several times.  From there the lunch arrived and everyone had well and truly finished then as everyone is ready to depart my salad arrived which was absolute ridiculous.And then we are expected to tip 20% for crap service - I can't criticise the rooms as I'm just here for lunch but no interest in an experience like that again!"

        "review_text": "I have been a loyal Fairmont customer for many years and have been a Fairmont President's Club Platinum member for years.  I have stayed at Fairmonts all over the world.  This property has THE WORST FRONT DESK service - EVER!!!!My problem with this property started shortly after I booked it with a Fairmont agent via their toll free number for Platinum members.  The agent who helped me book the stay was perfectly fine and he did a good job.  However, the reservation required a full pre-payment as soon as you book it - no problem.  I was told a certain amount and I expected it to come through my credit card right away.  Well, it came through alright, but at a higher amount than what was agreed upon.  I called the toll free number, explained the situation and the overcharge and I was told they made a mistake and will refund me the over charge.  Ok, that's fine (even though I lost $ on the currency conversion, as the credit card companies always give a worse exchange rate for refunds than charges).  I didn't make a fuss as it was not a lot of $ that I lost.  Then, a few days before our arrival, that same amount that was refunded to me was charged to my cc again!  I called and spoke with the hotel front office, explained the error.  The lady said she would refund it and would have the manager (Maggie) call me to discuss compensation.  Well, days went by and no refund and no call from the manager.  I tried calling the hotel front office again and got voicemails.  Couldn't talk to anyone.  I finally found Maggie's email address.  Sent her an email and she finally got back to me and agreed to correct their mistake, again, with a refund.  I explained that this is the second time that it has happened and I have spent days trying to fix this and have lost more $ with all this currency conversion.  I asked for compensation, twice, before she finally agreed to compensate me for the difference in currency exchange.  I'm still waiting for that to come through my credit card.  All this hassle was BEFORE I even got to the hotel!Being a Platinum member, I am guaranteed early arrival and late checkout.  I have never had any problems at any other Fairmont properties.  I indicated at the time of booking that we would need an early check in at noon.  Repeated it several times to the hotel prior to our arrival.  We arrived at 12:30pm on the day of check in and were told that our room was not ready!  I asked how long it would be?  Lady at the front desk said \"don't know\"!!  Apparently, my loyalty and Platinum membership means nothing to this Fairmont!  She simply told me and my family that we can store our luggage with the bell desk and go off to do whatever and they'll text me when the room is ready!When we finally got to our room, we were happy with it.  I had used one of my upgrade certificates and we did get a very nice suite.  It was large, clean and the beds were comfortable.  I have no complaints about housekeeping.  They do a fairly decent job cleaning the room.  The mini bar though was a bit tacky - everything is \"weighted\".  As soon as you lift anything up, it gets charged to your room, even if you don't consume it.  I know other hotels do this too sometimes, but I personally find it tacky and certainly isn't done at too many other Fairmonts.Our problem with the Front Desk didn't end with check in.  When I went to check out today and tried to apply my eCertificates to our dining costs, I was told that I couldn't use the dining certificates on the Easter brunch!  The front desk clerk said that the brunch was considered \"a banquet\" and so, the dining certificates cannot be used against that (this was never explained to me when I booked the brunch and honestly, I would not have booked the brunch if I had known that I couldn't use my dining certificates against it.  The brunch cost USD $600 for 3 people!!!  Ridiculously expensive but I booked it thinking that I could apply $250 against it).  I asked to speak with the manager and it was Maggie again!  She was adamant that she would not allow any dining certificates to be applied to the brunch.  She did not seem to care at all that I am a loyal Fairmont guest and a Platinum member.  Clearly, they don't need my business - that was her attitude!  In the end, I had to pay for the whole thing and was not able to use any of my dining certificates!I have never been treated so poorly by any staff at any Fairmonts around the world.  The staff at the Front Desk of this particular property really did not care about their loyal customers.  They have turned me off completely.  I would NEVER return to this property.  Their attitude at this front desk is not representative of the Fairmont brand.  Perhaps Fairmont HQ should do something about the management at this property.  If this was the first Fairmont that I have ever stayed at, it would have turned me off any other Fairmonts in the future.  Poor customer service starts at the top and I now understand why I got such extremely poor service from the Front Desk - it's because their Manager, Maggie, does not care about her customers or their loyalty.My nightmare didn't end with checking out.  Even as I was heading to the airport, I got an email from the front desk stating they needed me to send them one of the certificates' codes again as they either lost it or copied it down wrong and then I saw another charge come through my cc, as they had calculated my total wrong!Is there anything that this Front Office can do right?I will NEVER stay at this property again!"

Staff polished, professional, very friendly to plain old me in sweatshirt and jeans.  Cost very reasonable for area and amenities provided, which include manager's evening reception (free food and drink!) and real breakfast (chef-made omelets!) in morning.  Metro Red Line (subway) is just across the street so quick and easy access to tourist, government and business sites in downtown DC, including the zoo for the kiddies. High-end shopping (Tiffany's, Saks, Brooks Brothers, Whole Foods) a short stroll away, including nice shops in mall within the building. Reasonably safe, upscale neighborhood.  Room (suite) attractively and comfortably furnished. Bedroom very quiet.  Wet bar, fridge, and microwave. Go and enjoy!"

I cancelled within the Loews cancelation policy AND RECEIVED A CANCELATION CONFIRMATION. On March 15 (the day I left Chicago), Loews charged me the full amount ($536). I called and spoke to the hotel and they apologized and said it was a mistake. One week later they charged me a second time ($536). I called and spoke to the manager and the back office supervisor. They apologized and said they were refunding me both charged immediately. One week later I was charged a THIRD time. I have now been charged $1,608 by Loews Chicago and have not received any refund. Of course they admit this is a mistake and they are very apologetic. But I warn you... This property does not have their processes and systems functional and they will do the same to you. Do not give this hotel your credit card. I have spoken to Chris [--] (GM) and he admits they are mistakenly charging customers for stays they have not made. I have never been to this hotel and they now owe me $1,608. Be warned. This place is a process mess."

However, it faced a parking lot and was literally right over the recycling dumpster.  An apartment building shares the lot so there were trash pickups starting at 6:00 a.m. or so.  The second night some guys were having a very loud argument at 3:30 a.m. and we had to call security.

On arrival, the staff were super friendly and I especially enjoyed the complimentary local chocolate! We were checked into our room and upon looking out the window saw we were facing a brick wall. We called concierge to ask if it would be possible to move and they upgraded us to a better room at no charge! We were in a Deluxe King Room which was great space wise with a massive bathroom and super comfy bed. We loved the lobby bar with games available. Although in a central location right off Market St, we found the area to be a little 'edgy' and if staying again in San Fran would probably opt for an area like Russian Hill or North Beach near Washington Square Park, which we discovered on one of our walks one day. All in all, for Zetta a great hotel with great staff and great rooms in an OK area."

        "review_text": "The hotel is in a good location and is comfortable.However, I can't recommend this hotel for a few reasons which I think everyone should be aware of before making the choice to book their stay here. On the last day of our trip, we checked out of the hotel around 11am and went to walk around the city. We left our baggage with the bell service. We came back to the hotel around 3pm to head out of Chicago. Its after we got home, that we realized several valuables were stolen from our bags during the baggage hold process. I immediately contacted W Chicago to notify of this issue and I was  asked to file a report. I was told they will investigate and get back to me within a week. Well, that was 6 months ago! I spoke to two extremely unprofessional staff members and have done what was asked for, including filing their reports w/ details.Nicholas BaezJeremy DasilvaNeither of them have contacted me since, and haven't responded to my emails regarding the investigation or let me know what has happened. I'm assuming this matter is now being ignored so as to not dig any deeper into what seems like a really big issue with W's service and general robbery of guests and thefts which are persistent at this hotel. In fact one of the staff members I spoke to mentioned this has happened recently with other guests and hence would appreciate if I can get as many details as possible over to them (which we did to our ability). Please make sure you are aware of this issue before you stay here. Its probably worth checking out several other hotels in the neighborhood and save yourself the trouble of being robbed or worse!"

        "review_text": "I booked and paid in full, online, with Lexington, in advance. When we arrived, they wanted another $100 advance charge. Then, they informed me that we were being charged an additional $22.60 per night \" HOTEL SERVICE CHARGE \". They never explained what that was. I argued about it and they said they waived it but I still have the $100 pre-charge on my credit card outstanding. I canceled the second night well within their time frame but I have never received a refund for this canceled night that I paid for in advance. The noise was horrible until about 2:00 A. M. The elevators were horrible and the parking was rediculous. I will never stay at another Lexington ever. This was the first and last time."

        "review_text": "TLDR:  Great trendy boutique hotel that, as I have proven, not only caters very well to yuppies and techies but also to families (unexpectedly).  I will surely come back and certainly will refer.  To Carolyn and staff: Thank you for the great experience and chocolates.  The kids very much appreciate your hospitality.  I hope our hotels in Vegas can return the favor when you guys visit.  Contact me when you're in town.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Coming from an ultra expensive price with sub mediocre quality inn in Monterey my family and I found a perfect break out of our road trip in this hotel 3 nights ago.  I'm a huge fan of boutique hotels though were a bit apprehensive booking at first as my wife and I had our 2 kiddos with us, I went ahead and did it.Upon arrival, Brandon was a breath of fresh air as he immediately helped us out of our car from the stressful traffic on 5th street.  His engagement and chat with me was very welcomed after almost having an aneurysm driving through an unusual-super-jammed-stop-stop-(almost no go)-SanFran-traffic. Walking into the hotel Carolyn and Hans made things even better.  They were both very pleasant, warm, and welcoming.  They were great with the kids!!!  Both took no time to explain to us the \"green\" initiative of the hotel and all the fun amenities it provides.  Even, encouraging the kids to the 2nd floor playroom which was a lot of fun.  Their warmth, terrific service and courtesy were spot on especially grateful for them making my kids feel welcome (at every sight) despite of the very yuppie presence in the hotel.  Joseph also made a big difference as he attended to both myself and the kids later that night while at the playroom.  Daniel, my fellow Subie fan, is also a fantastic all around kind of guy.The room we had was a double queen and while it would have been perfect for a couple of folks, it was a bit small for 4 especially with the 2 kids.  I was kind of hoping for a complimentary upgrade.  No big deal however.  The room was clean, the tech was awesome - Jawbone is convenient and alright quality but a great addition to a very contemporary setup.  Couldn't get the G-link + Ipad-Netflix to work as the wireless disconnects upon glink connection; maybe it was just me.  The artwork are fantastic, especially \u2665 the floppy-disc-woman-face art.  Power outlets are ample and found no use for using my own anymore.  View was good as we had a room facing 5th street.  Coffee machine is superb with complimentary coffee - perfect!*Tips: Most of everything are recycled in the hotel.  Pay close attention to the details and it'll amaze you - guard dog at the lobby, chandelier made of eye glasses, artworks, lighting systems, etc... DON'T MISS the graffiti in the stairwell.  8th to the bottom floor is painted with an urban tasteful art, sure adds a wilder character to the hotel.*Only issue: I found that the men's restroom's urinal at the lobby without a flush.  A couple of times I used it, the bathroom had the distinct foul smell.  Maybe install a timed flush system. It's especially worse when patrons at the bar uses the restroom.  It just tarnishes the overall quality of the hotel.*Suggestions for greener initiative:  Automation.  Auto sensing lights so they turn off when no guests are in the room.  It adds more green value to the hotel plus it'd be nice for the lights to turn on automatically when we walk back into the room late at night.  Nest-like thermostat so electiricity can be managed with auto-away.  Wireless-mobile keycards to get rid of plastic room keys.  Mobile app instead of paper menus for mini-bar and in-room dining.  Paperless bills sent through email or text message."

        "review_text": "If you are expecting five star luxury you are looking in the wrong place. However if you are looking for a very well priced, friendly establishment White Sands is it. You feel like you are on the set of a sixties Hawaiian tv show, we have a kitchenette, plus the usual, king size bed, large fridge, medium size tv (not tiny) with a PlayStation for DVDs and music, good cupboards and bathroom. As I said the building is old but the fittings are all functional. Just a short walk (50metres) to cross a Main street then through the International Market cross another street walk through a few shops and you are either in Dukes restaurant, Cheesecake restaurant, the Outrigger Hotel and you are on Waikiki beach which has everything you could want. It's a maximum 10 minute walk from White Sands. The staff here are so polite and helpful, the ladies who maintain the rooms are also fantastic, it is truly a nice atmosphere here at White Sands we are into our fifth week here, initially only booked for four but decided to have our other two weeks here, it has a small village feel about it. We will stay here again."

He took us on a mini tour of the city, and took our photo on Lombard street.  We had a wonderful view of the Golden Gate Bridge and other sights from our room.  We would definitely stay there again when we have to go back to Stanford for my check up in a few years."

        "review_text": "So, we arrived at the Tahiti Village Saturday, travelling from the UK. I\u2019m afraid to say that all the bad reviews about horrendous check in are true! We are staying here for 2 weeks, booked it months ago and filled in a request form that told the hotel we would be arriving around 1pm. Check in is officially 4pm but when check out is 10am can they really not turn rooms around for people that have travelled from so far away? We were not greeted with a smile, made to feel like we were an inconvenience and informed curtly that our room would not be ready until 4pm. Fair enough, we took our 3 kids, ages 3, 5 and 17 to the pool area and let them have a splash about. After a 10 hour flight and several hours either end at airports they were pretty tired but got a second wind at the pool so all was well, until... We queued up at the check in desk again at 4pm (average of 30 mins in line) only to be told our room was still not ready, again no apologies or smiles and no estimate of when it might be ready. We dragged the children to Denny\u2019s for a bite to eat then joined the half hour queue again for check in. Now after 5pm and our 5 year old could take to more so he went to sleep in our buggy while our 3 year old lay on a bench in the lobby. Not the best start to our $5,000 stay at this hotel!!! We finally got into our room around 5:30pm opened up our cases and all went to bed. All this aside I can say the room is lovely, really spacious and has everything you would need so that is good. As I said we only arrived yesterday so I\u2019m hoping by the end of our stay I can leave another and more positive review."

        "review_text": "We stayed at Made Hotel for a week whilst getting married in New York.We picked the hotel based on the good reviews of others who had stayed whilst celebrating a big occasion, and for the location and beautiful decor.The last two didn\u2019t disappoint. The hotel is very nicely decorated and the location is perfect for exploring New York.Unfortunately the biggest day of our lives was completely ignored by the stuck up hipsters that run this place! I read on another review that the attitude is \u201cwe\u2019re cool, why aren\u2019t you\u201d and I\u2019ve never read a truer word!Good points:Rooms clean.Decor really very nice.Man in coffee shop was pleasant.Bad points:Hipsters.Nowhere to put clothes as they provide 3 hangers and no wardrobe.Hipsters partying constantly on roof terrace and the music travels down the lift shaft.Fire alarm at 3am.Hipsters ignoring your wedding cos they\u2019re too cool.Hipsters mistakenly thanking you for drinking at their hipster bar as you exit the lift, even though you\u2019ve just spent $2.5k to stay at their hotel.Hipster lighting is so dark it\u2019s practically impossible to apply make up.Fries were served soggy in a warmed up microwave bowl with a lid on. Yum.If you\u2019re a 22 year old Instagram model living off daddies money then I highly recommend staying here!If you\u2019re not, then I\u2019d suggest taking your hard earned cash elsewhere and enjoying your holiday somewhere that appreciates your custom.I\u2019d just like to point out I\u2019m only 31 and have never felt so old, uncool and unwelcome in my entire life. You didn\u2019t spoil our trip Made Hotel, but you really made me feel like the frumpy old auntie at the cool kids party on my wedding day. Cheers."

        "review_text": "Our first trip to Hawaii and we wanted to stay at this historic hotel in Honolulu.  I had reserved, we'll in advance, a Garden View room with a king bed.  Checked in at 3pm and was told all the king rooms are gone and they have one room left with two double beds.  Or, for another $100 more per night, they can give us one with an ocean view.  I let that go and say no thanks, we'll take the garden view with two double beds. And the woman that checked us in was not very pleasant.  It seemed like we were annoying her.  We get up to our room and open the curtain to find a view, not of a garden, but of a wall.  OK, we let that go too.  Then we turn on the tv later that night, only to find the remote doesn't work.  Call Guest Services and they send up someone who says we need a new tv and he'll be back with one.  Well, that didn't happen either.  All on our first day here.  Very, very disappointed.  At this point, this will be our one and only trip to Hawaii.  If we do come back again, we will definitely NOT stay at this hotel.  Don't waste your money on a stay at this hotel.  It is definitely NOT worth it."

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Chicago Sofitel for 6 nights while on vacation. Overall it was a very disappointing experience and failed to meet my most basic expectations. I am generally a easy guest to please (the majority of my tripadvisor reviews are four and five stars). But this hotel is the worst hotel I have stayed at. This is my 93rd Tripadvisor hotel review, but it is the first time I am rating a hotel one star.The stay got off to bad start upon arrival. I had pre-booked a room with two beds (as I was travelling with a relative) but upon arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite. However, the suite contained one bed and one sofa bed. I explained to the receptionist that I had booked a room with two beds, but I was told there was no rooms with two beds available. The receptionist assured us that the Junior Suite was a fantastic room and that the sofa bed was in fact very comfortable and already made up. As we checked in after 10pm we reluctantly accepted the receptionists advice. Upon entering the room it was pretty clear that the \u2018upgrade\u2019 was actually a downgrade. Firstly, the sofa bed hadn\u2019t been made up. Secondly, it was clear that it was a very basic sofa bed (eg, thin mattress, metal bars). The reality is that even a typical bed in a basic one star guesthouses is more comfortable than a sofa bed. This bungle with the room was particularly disappointing given that I had booked and paid for this Sofitel four months in advance, I had checked in online prior to arrival, and I am a Platinum member of the Accor/Sofitel loyalty program.It is inexcusable that a hotel that charges premium prices and positions itself as a luxury brand can oversell a room. The response of the hotel to the room stuff up was disappointing. There was no prior warning. There was no contingency (eg, take a spare bed out of storage). And the idea that we were being offered an \u2018upgrade\u2019 was fanciful. I didn\u2019t book a five star hotel (and pay a premium price) to sleep on a sofa bed. After my stay I provided this feedback to the hotel and their templated reply offered an insulating 500 loyalty points (worth 10 euros) as a good will gesture. I would have much preferred a simple acknowledgement that the room overselling was just not good enough.It was only after I called reception and explained my disappointment that they offered to move us to a room with two beds for the remaining 5 nights (and only because a room was \u2018fortunately\u2019 available). The room we moved to was a Prestige Suite which was spacious, quiet, and meticulously clean. However, the room\u2019s hotchpotch of amenities needs improving. I\u2019ll give a couple of examples below, but I could provide numerous other examples. On the one hand we were provided with things like \u2018shoe mitt\u2019, \u2018mouth wash\u2019, and designer Evian bottled water (shipped half way across the world even though Chicago has some of the cleanest, safest, and healthiest water in the world). Yet the room was missing some of the most basic amenities that are standard in most hotels. For example, the room offered no kettle. Like nearly 2-3 billion people around the world I like to drink tea daily and this is not possible without a kettle. I can\u2019t picture the same number of people using a shoe mitt as part of their daily routine. The room offered a Nespresso pod coffee machine. But there were no ceramic cups, metal tea spoons, or even milk. Instead there were 8 ounce paper cups, plastic stirrers, and a condiment kit containing plenty of nothing. This hotel prides itself on appealing to a European \u2018French\u2019 sensibility to the point where guests are greeted with \u2018Bonjour\u2019 and \u2018Bonsoir\u2019. Yet the thought of a Frenchman drinking espresso out of a giant paper cup is not exactly luxury. A Nespresso machine makes decent coffee, but there is no point in providing this if you can\u2019t get these other basics right. Even a $20 a night Ibis I stayed at recently had real ceramic cups. We ended up asking for some milk at the bar. However there was nowhere to store the milk as the mini-fridge had a sign attached saying that it was for mini-bar items only. This is a hotel that believes it is more important keeping Pringles and Jelly Beans chilled, than actually providing a space for guests to keep essentials chilled. We ignored the sign and placed the milk in the mini-fridge. This was a very bad idea!Upon check-out we were presented with a bill that included approximately $100 of extras. This included $60 of mini-bar charges even though we hadn\u2019t consumed anything from the mini-bar. As it turned out, when we placed the milk in the fridge we set off sensors which automatically charged mini-bar items to our room. This Sofitel is operating in a customer service sphere that thinks it is acceptable to charge a customer not based on the fact that they have consumed the mini-bar items, but merely moved them. It is a shameful and appalling service mentality. It is definitely not 5 star service. I wouldn\u2019t even expect this from one star accommodation. My feedback to this hotel is that if you are unable to provide a mini-bar service that is respectful and practical for guests then you shouldn\u2019t offer a mini-bar service at all. In our case the mini-bar was an inconvenience.The remaining $40 was a service charge for breakfast. This was a breakfast that on the booking confirmation was described as 'free\u2019 and 'inclusive'. I queried this and the receptionist wasn\u2019t able to explain the breakdown of the surcharge - he said it was \u2018around 15% service fee\u2019. I later found out it was 18%. But 18% of what? I don\u2019t recall seeing prices listed anywhere.  The hotel management would be well advised to google the definition of  \u2018free\u2019 and \u2018inclusive\u2019. \u2018Free\u2019 is defined as \u2018without cost or payment\u2019. \u2018Inclusive\u2019 is defined as \u2018including all the services or items normally expected or required\u2019. I know that the US has a unique tipping culture, but the meaning of these words are crystal clear and mean the same no matter what country you are in. If the hotel wants to charge a service fee for breakfast that is fine, but it should be transparent and specify this on the booking confirmation. I\u2019ve stayed at other hotels in the US where breakfast was included and there was never any surprise charges. I can honestly say that this is the first hotel I have ever stayed anywhere in the world where the \u2018free\u2019 breakfast wasn\u2019t actually free.Breakfast was mixed. This hotel offered a la carte rather than a buffet breakfast. The meals offered quantity over quality and were poorly balanced. For example the oatmeal was just a giant plate of oatmeal. The pancakes were 4 pancakes with syrup. We ended asking for 2 pancakes with a side of fruit which was much more appetising. The savoury meals were served with a side of roast potatoes which were unpalatable and not a very appropriate choice for breakfast. We weren\u2019t alone in this assessment as we noticed numerous guests left their potatoes untouched. Pastries were good quality and the coffee was drinkable but mediocre. The fruit tasted like it had been pre-prepared and had been sitting in the fridge overnight -  and in particular the cantaloupe was hard, flavourless and inedible on all six mornings.The WIFI was reliable but slow. It was not possible to stream a medium quality video. I\u2019ve experienced better internet at even very basic hotels. The internet speed is not good enough for a 5 star hotel in a major city.Accor Le Club loyalty benefits at this hotel are meagre. We received a complementary drink voucher and in addition a mouthful of stale cake and bottle of Evian water were waiting in our room on arrival. To be honest, I\u2019ve received better Le Club benefits staying at Accor's economy Ibis brand.Overall this was a very poor experience (in particular because of the booking stuff up and billing issues). This hotels promises a lot, but fails to deliver.  I would not return to this hotel, nor would I recommend it."

        "review_text": "We decided to stay at the Loews Regency because last year, around the same time , we stayed at the same location, but was called Mandarin Oriental.  It was a great experience and I reviewed about it.  When I was looking to book Mandarin Oriental to stay this time, I found out this hotel is the new Loews Regency.  But we nevertheless decided to stay here because of the wonderful experience last year.  Man, what a difference the two brands made.It all started with the booking.  I usually go to the Expedia first to get a transparent price - Expedia almost always tells you the price + other taxes.  I then go to the hotel website to book the room.  My experience was that such hotels usually offers pretty much the same prices as offered on internet.  When I went to Loews Regency's website, it gives a more expensive price but did say that they were going to match the internet offer and gave a number to call.  So I called, what I waste of time.  I was told that the rooms offered on the internet were no longer available (seriously? I was on the website while I was calling), I did not press, it was not much different in price anyway.  In addition, I was assured that the room I was booked over the phone would have a better view and a higher floor.  Let me say this, I hate vendors being petty, especially when it comes about matching price.  So it left a bit bad taste in my mouth with this booking experience.Lack of attention to details is our general impression with this hotel.  Over the phone, when I was asked for the purpose of the stay, I told the hotel reservation specialist that it was to celebrate my husband's birthday.  So they asked my husband's name. However, at the check-in, everyone wished me happy birthday.  Also at the check-in, when we were given the choices of newspaper to have in the morning, WSJ, NYTimes, or FT, we picked NYTimes.  What delivered was WSJ.  One of the bath towels in our bath had way over extended its life-cycle, looked just like a Motel 6 towel.  As every other 5-star hotel provides gourmet coffee/tea options in the room, there is no such option at Lowes in San Francisco.Everyone knows the quality of the hotel can be seen from the bathroom.  Now look at this picture: The shower is shower over tub, not different from Marriott (honestly, I did not mind it much when it was Mandarin Oriental - it just tells you the bad impressions really added up), the toiletries looked really cheap and the hair dryer was very heavy, and the toilet was really made for dwarves.The room that I was assured to have was sitting on the top floor, but right by the elevator.  At six o'clock in the morning, I started hearing pings non-stop because there was only one elevator in operation to take all the Financial District visitors/business persons to work and to meetings.  When I brought it up at the check out, the only explanation was that the hotel was upgrading the elevator system so basically, you just have to put up with it.Let me say this, this hotel was no comparison to other 5 star hotels in San Francisco.  Especially since the hotel is under renovation, at least make it clear on the website or at the time of booking or just do not call it a 5-star yet.  In 2002, the Vltava river flooded the Four Seasons in Prague.  When Four seasons reopened its door in late 2003, it first classified itself as a four-star hotel while there was still some construction and repair going on.Maybe it's just because the hotel is in the FiDi and therefore there is no lack of supply of customers.  But to build a brand, you need a sustained, consistent commitment to quality of service, which include but not limited to attention to details and product honesty - all of which should not be compromised by location or demand.  Oh, by the way, for a business hotel, the WiFi is way too slow\u2026\u2026To be fair, the people working there are very friendly, I believe lots of them (I am sure of the SPA personnels) were previously employed by Mandarin Oriental.  But something has definitely changed\u2026...There are so many choices for good hotels, honestly, I would not go back to Loews again."

        "review_text": "There are so many hotels on Waikiki it is hard to choose the right one. We stayed at Outrigger but ate some meals at other hotels and our tours sometimes picked up other travelers at various hotels as well. After what I have seen I definitely think Outrigger was the best option for us. The rooms are very comfortable, and everyone we interacted with was very professional. Dukes was one of the best restaurants we saw the whole time.We ate one meal at the Hilton and I was not impressed by the food, service or especially the prices. The rooms may be a little cheaper but they make their money in the restaurant."

        "review_text": "I would like to start this review by saying I have TWICE emailed the hotel to let them know of my concerns and as they haven't bothered to contact me ( more evidence of the abysmal service), so I will write a TA review. I hate to see reviews where the hotel hasn't been informed of the issues, but I gave them chance to respond, during the stay and immediately after.Essentially, this hotel looks great and friends of mine were impressed that we were staying at \" The Modern\"? I quite like the minimalistic reception, the pools were attractive and never too busy, there is easy access to the beach along the sky path towards the Hilton next door and the bedrooms are large and clean considering we booked the economy/standard room.Now, the problems started when we found out ( not upon check in),  that the pools were closed due to a private food and wine event the hotel was hosting. Not the welcome you want on your 1st day, it was boiling and we had just flown from a cold US mainland and were looking forward to heading to the pool. A heads up before our arrival would have been appreciated, instead, a letter in our room notified of this.Next to this letter was another letter from hotel management, informing us that they have recently taken over this building and realise there are amenities missing that their guests would usually expect from them. How bizarre. Why not just address that, or reduce rates until you're a fully functioning hotel, what madness!There was an iron, slippers, robe, pod coffee machine and fresh water each day, but I personally thought they were missing side plates, wine glasses and a fridge that was colder on the inside than it is on the outside ( hardly modern). Having no light on the balcony was a pain and the stupid balcony shutter door was inconveniently placed and a few times we walked into the patio door because of poor design.The first night we barely slept as the in-house nightclub was pumping music until the early hours and the walls were vibrating. You pay a hotel in exchange for a place to sleep- this was unacceptable and led us to check TA reviews the following morning, where by we found similar reviews regarding the hotel closing the pool for private functions and poor service.I found the staff to be generally obnoxious, too young and have no idea what good service looks like. Reception staff have no idea how to welcome and farewell guests. We were given a key upon check in and no further information was provided, not even, the lift is behind you to the right, or the pool is on this floor, or, the pools are closed today by the way! Same service on check out- nobody asked about our stay, or thanked us for our stay, or asked where we were heading to next.This meant our overall perception of the hotel was tarnished and we found it difficult to look beyond and enjoy what was great about this place. We are thoroughly disappointed and feel we grossly overpaid for this experience. This was our final destination before flying back to NZ and this hotel really let us down.  We will not be recommending to anybody until I see reviews to the contrary- staff need to go to customer service classes, especially considering they expect tips in for service in the US, what a joke."

Plus, the rooms were deeply discounted for a 4 star DC hotel. Our room was nice and spacious, and every employee we encountered was at the top of their game, but other than that, the hotel was just average. Food choices are weak and a lot of work still needs to be done. The location isn't great but there is a subway right there, and it's easy to get around DC"

        "review_text": "I stayed at Tahiti Village using my ownership week and checking out on 6/2.  I stayed in the Royal Tahitian Suite and was placed in a very outdated room facing the Motel 6 and parking lot.  Our family initially tried to make the best of this, however soon realized that we were placed on a floor that was literally in the middle of renovations (see pics attached). There was constant hammering from 8am-6pm the entire stay.  We asked the front desk to be moved several times, however was told there was nowhere we could move, although the resort was not even close to being at full occupancy.  After a couple of more conversations with the front desk, we were then offered to be moved to a smoking room, although I am pregnant and have kids with severe allergies.Given we had no options, we essentially spent the rest of our ownership week in a construction zone, even having couches from other rooms placed in front of our room entryway on several occasions.  I will definitely look into selling my ownership and will not give Tahiti Village the right to abuse their power this way in the future.  The only reason I am giving a 1 star is because the pool area was a nice retreat from our room and the shuttle service to the strip."

It has been sold to Wyndham timeshares and they were relentless in their sales pitch of wanting us to attend a meeting.  They woke us every morning with 8:30am phone calls, 6 of them in one morning, bugging us in the lobby, leaving notes on our doors and in other words being so pushy we ended up leaving early. And in our three day stay they did not clean our room once, yet on the day we were trying to leave, housekeeping barged in twice while we were still in there. The room was beautiful, roomy and recently remodeled, however the bathrooms were in pretty bad shape. Think twice before booking here."

When we first arrived we were checked in by a the front desk, which he was not very friendly or helpful. We had to change our room from a King to 2 Queens but the only room available was a smoking room, which we were fine with. Once we went up to our room, one of the housekeepers stopped us and told us the room wasn't ready yet and she'll clean it up. We arrived at 8pm, and she was a nice lady and cleaned up the room while we were in it but told us that someone else just requested to switch rooms and after she was done, we found out why they wanted a different room, there was a USED CONDOM in the trash and beds weren't cleaned correctly the first time. That was the last draw, we checked out 5 hours after checking in and was not offered any money back. The front desk just asked if we wanted a new room and we said no, and all she said back was \"Ok, have a good night.\" TERRIBLE SERVICE AND DIRTY ROOM, will not go back ever."

That's crazy,it's like been charge for using jym in a hotel or sitting in a lobby and be charged!!! As for the price we paid (arround 500$ per night) it's absurd! Hotel is isolated,but if u need privacy it's one for u,even though it's nothing to do here,few overpriced restaurants ,small pool,and small beach .Also they are advertising their dolphin lagoon-to swim with dolphins 10 min,my 6years  old needs to be accompanied with grown up(double charge of course,what the instructors or dolphin trainers are for) 250$ .Not worth the money,pretty sure it's better deals in Honolulu than this one."

However, on check in we were asked to pay $750 deposit for our room even though the hotel had been paid for upon arrival.. This worked out at $150 a night! If we'd have stayed any longer we would have nothing left to enjoy miami! When asked why this was they said it was hotel policy. We paid the money but then had less spending money for the rest of our trip so couldn't do the trips we wanted to do like the everglades and biscayne bay. We were never told by our tour operator or the hotel prior to booking this so it was an unexpected cost on arrival!Having said all of the above, the rooms were beautifully decorated, huge comfy beds and amazing walk in shower! It was ideal location for south beach and ocean drive.I would definitely return to this hotel again, but this time making sure I have double the money to cover the deposit costs of the hotel."

        "review_text": "The main thing you should know about this hotel is that it is a luxury hotel in a historic building in the heart of Washington DC that also happens to brand new (for now).Wife and I stayed at the Trump International Hotel for a wedding. The Old Post Office has been turned into a beautiful hotel with great amenities and great service.We arrived in DCA, took the metro direct to Federal Triangle. This metro stop happens to be on the back side of the hotel, so we walked around the hotel to the entrance, which does not face Pennsylvania Ave. Upon arrival, our room was not yet ready, but the front desk was able to hold our bags while we went to lunch. Our room was 441, and looked directly over the giant American flags onto Pennsylvania Ave.  Our \"Trump Attache\" escorted us to our (Greek revival styled) room and gave us a quick tour, showing us the curtain control switches and the do not disturb button.Some notes on the room, in no particular order.-The king-sized bed was plush and very comfortable.-The room had ample power outlets and usb ports-The Nescafe machine made great coffee, although more of a European style. Tea was also available-The signature Trump golden shower was spacious with a fixed shower head and a wand. The water pressure was excellent, as was the ability to get hot water. The bathroom included a double vanity and elongated toilet, but no bidet. Plenty of towels for two people. Decent shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, mouth wash.- Could not hear other rooms, so noise isolation seemed good. However, if a military band starts marching in the morning to practice for inauguration, it will wake you up.-The TV was a large flat screen with a great selection of channels, including things like BEIN sport, to watch international football matches. Unlike most hotel systems, it was a responsive system aimed at actually letting you watch high def TV.-The room included a small refrigerator, which we did not have occasion to use.-The minibar had a nice selection of liquor, but caveat emptor. Popping open the fifth of Knob Creek will set you back $69, which is a bargain, drink for drink, compared to the hotel bar, I suppose. The Evian that the maid service will leave for you costs $10 per bottle. If you need a free bottle of water, I recommend visiting the gym. I do not believe we were billed for eating the chocolates left by the maid service, however.- My wife had so little difficulty with the wifi that I didn't even know she was using it until I asked as we were leaving. I assume it was easy to connect with plenty of speed. Personally, I never connected my phone to it because I have VZW unlimited data. For the record, I never recall losing my verizon signal or my wife complaining about her ATT signal anywhere in the hotel or ballrooms.- The gym is absolutely one of the best hotel gyms I have seen. Lots of new equipment including an assortment of weight machines, free weights, treadmills, ellipticals.  The treadmills have responsive touch screen TVs. Cheapo earbuds were available. Somehow, my wife and I were the only people in the gym, and with it smelling new and being new, it was wonderful.- The old post office tower will be opened after inauguration. I've been to the top years ago, and it is a great view of the city and worth the visit.- Quick walk to National Mall- Presidential ballroom is elegant. Wedding went off with only 1 hitch.- Hotel service was attentive and friendly. There is genuine concern that you might have to move your own suitcase.- Sorry, no comments on the spa (closed), restaurant/bar (avoided)"

        "review_text": "I am a HGVC member.  My family and I stayed there between Feb 18th - Feb 25th.  We had a two bedroom Premier suite with a partial view of the ocean.The rooms are as you would expect from a HGVC property.  Full Kitchen, washer and dryer, quiet, clean, comfortable beds, etc.  No complaints about the room.I don't really have any complaints about the property but I think people visiting should know the following.Hawaiian village is made up of several hotels and Grand vacation towers.  The closest to the beach is the lagoon tower and the rainbow tower.  I did not know that before booking and while I could see the beach from my balcony, it was a 10-15 minute walk from Grand Waikikian to the beach.You have to rent chairs and umbrellas - chairs are $15 each and umbrella was $30.  You can keep them from 8am - 5pm.   They will boot your out of them at 5pm sharp!  we could get up and go get lunch and come back.  There is no butler service.  The beach is not maintained so watch your step.  I did not see anyone raking the sand or cleaning up.  Not so say that did not happen after 5pm, I personally did not see it.This place is HUGE so get a map and use the friendly Concierge, bellmen, and front desk staff for directions.  This is not a place I would bring anyone people who does not like to or can't walk a lot.  I would never bring my parents here.  You have to walk far to get to everything.  There is no restaurant in GW so you have to walk into Hawaiian Village of off property.  We did 10,000 steps a day while there and we were not trying.  I barely get 2000 steps at home!!!If you want to save money, go to the ABC store or to a local grocery store and pick up cereal, eggs, bacon, lunch meat, etc.  DO NOT buy groceries in the lobby store.  A box of frosted flakes cost $10.95.   Hawaii is expensive in general but prices on the property are ridiculous.The pools looked so much bigger on the website.  They are not large, so they are always packed.  There are a lot of kids and noise.  If you want peace and quiet this is not the place for you. Its hustle and bustle.  Honolulu is in an extremely populated area and all around you will see high rise buildings and traffic.  This is why I prefer the big island or Maui.  I was with newbies who wanted to see Peal Harbor,etc.Best place to eat for us was DUKE's!!!  Drinks and food were excellent!!!   Its a WALK from the hotel or you can spend about 10 bucks by cab.We did not rent a car but some friends did.  There was a $39 dollar a day fee for parking.  Valet was more.  We walked most places so i'm not sure we needed it but if you really want to get around the island I would recommend renting a car.You must visit the Polynesian Cultural Center. the play there was awesome---not the luau----the play.   It is an all day adventure.  You learn all about the different Polynesian cultures that thread through Hawaii.  Each has a village with two to three buildings/huts and they do presentations about their cultures, traditions, dances, clothes, etc.  The walking was minimal b/c in each village you stop, sit and listen.  the next village is close. There are only about 6 of them. One of the cool things was most of the workers in the different villages were from that actual island.  Of course, there are restaurants/food stands and you can buy food packages.  The hotel has a shuttle for $23.00 ea one way.  it is about an hour drive and you follow the coast to get there so its a scenic drive.  Beware, the shuttle stops at different hotels to pick up and drop off - it's only about 5 though.  We took a cab going ---big mistake $$$$ and took the shuttle going back.  We were the second drop off.The luau at Hawaiian village was okay. This was my third one in life, I've had better.  it cost about $114.00 if you are a member. This luau does not show the pig coming out of the ground---if that's important to you.  I don't like my food looking at me so I could care less but some people want the full experience.  The Hawaiian pork was on the buffet and it was yummy!!!  the food was luke warm though.If you are an owner make sure you get discount books from the concierge.  If you are not an owner, you need to talk fast b/c they will try to get you to attend a time share presentation for 90 minutes of your life.  The book has discounts for the different restaurants/shops in Hawaiian Village and the luau----at those prices you want all the help you can get.Now, consider yourself informed!  Safe Travels!"

        "review_text": "I cannot say enough about this beautiful place.  We were intrigued by the reviews, but once I saw how busy and loud Waikiki beach was I was so grateful for this location.  It's a very short (but beautiful) walk to town either on the beach or through the park.  Both are well lit with people around so I never felt uncomfortable walking at night. You can literally hear the city noise fading away as you get closer to the property.There's no pool, but we prefer the beach and they have a beautiful one here.  It was never over-crowded even though all beaches are public.  The hotel provides towels and beach mats, and even let us use chairs at no charge after we asked.We reserved the Ocean Front Deluxe room (818) and it was spacious and beautiful.  The bed was really comfortable- my only complaint was that the pillows were really hard so after two nights I left a note for housekeeping and came home to find two awesome down pillows on the bed.  We had a huge bathroom and also a really long balcony. We couldn't have asked for a better view.Do not miss breakfast!  I'm not even a breakfast eater, but this was some of the best food I had in Hawaii (and we'd spent the previous week at the Westin in Maui!)  We had the regular breakfast with a huge piece of ham, potatoes, eggs, toast, and coffee.  On the last day there I ordered the Macadamia/Coconut French toast with fresh berries, and discovered their coconut syrup- I thought I'd died and gone to Carb Heaven.I can't brag on the staff enough! All of the Valet staff were eager to assist in any way possible, but Tony was soooo helpful in recommending local \"dives\" for the best food.  (Ono Hawaiian Foods is incredible- get the lau lau) He had the best personality, and full of energy.  I'd already mentioned our awesome housekeeping lady, and the concierge, Joy, was on point if we needed a car rental or info.I would highly recommend this property, especially if you hate crowds.  You won't be disappointed!"

        "review_text": "5-day stay at Parc 55 has been a pleasure. Being a solo traveler, I needed to feel safe in my hotel and have amenities easily accessible - and Parc 55 definitely delivered. Check in/Check Out process was very fast, and the staff were very polite and accommodating. Concierge desk is also very helpful. Good complimentary WIFI access as a Hilton Honors member - very fast and doesn't drop out. My room and bathroom were very clean - no complaints. My only complaint would be that one of the staff members from the bell desk could be a little more polite and friendly, like the rest of the Parc 55 staff.Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone, its costs are justified by services and amenities."

        "review_text": "Worst hotel experience I've had in my life.I play a lot at Binions and a little at the Four Queens, so I got invited to an invitational slot tournament that came with 3 comped room nights.  At check in they told me of a program where if you turn down the maid service, you get a $10 credit for each day.  I took them up on the offer and after going up to my room and coming back down I asked about it again.  They said it was all taken care of in the computer -- there are no \"do not disturb signs\" or anything to notify the maids not to come in.  The maids check a computer to figure out what rooms they need to clean.  Fair enough.Truthfully, I've never really needed maid service at a hotel.  I don't change my own towels and bedding every day at home.  Mostly I don't want people going through my stuff.  I've heard too many stories of people having things stolen or lost because of this.  So, being able to say no to maid service and getting a $10 food credit is great for me.My girlfriend and I go out the next day for a bit and come back.  Maids have cleaned up the room and moved all our stuff around.  I call the front desk, they check my account and tell me that according to the computer I am set up to not have maid service, so the maids just made a mistake.  The next day the maids did not come, thankfully.The last day of my stay the checkout time is 12 PM.  I go out for a bit in the morning and then come back a little before 10 AM to take a shower and get the last of my stuff and check out.  The maid is in my room.  She says she thought I already checked out and has already thrown everything in the room away.  Clothes I had put in the bathroom to change into after my shower are now sitting in the hallway.  I also had some pills and who even knows where they were.  I'm pretty upset and tell her that I have the room until Noon and I need to take a shower.  She tells me again that she thought I checked out and that there are cleaning chemicals in the shower.  While she gets her stuff and leaves the room I go downstairs to get some help.They check my account and tell me that I for sure have not checked out so there is no reason for the maid to think I have checked out.  I ask if there is a manager and they tell me there is no manager there until Noon (!).  They do get in touch with someone on the housekeeping staff (I think) but then proceed to tell that person that the maid threw out my luggage, bills, and important papers.  I never said anything about any of that, and none of that was true anyway.I go back upstairs and the important stuff is now back in the room -- a couple of bottles of water, some medicine, and my clothes.  I get in the shower and then there is a knock on the door.  I finish my shower and look outside the room and they are now going through the trash that the maid threw out looking for my important papers and bills that the front desk told them about.  So I had to clear that up.It's completely inexcusable to keep coming into my room when I check, double check, and triple check that they should not be cleaning my room.  It's completely inexcusable to start throwing away my stuff over 2 hours before checkout.Other highlights of the trip include:* An ice machine only every 4 floors.  Luckily our floor had an ice machine, except that part of the hall was closed off due to renovations!  According to someone else it was that entire side of the building, so the only way to get ice in the hotel was to call room service!* Did I mention that room service has a staff of one person?  I called and got an answering machine that stated \"If you are hearing this message then I am out delivering an order!\"* It's quite loud at night due to being right on Fremont street.  I stayed at The D before (right next door) and I couldn't hear any noise from the live music nightly, but it's very loud at the Four Queens.* The TV was pretty crappy.  Fuzzy picture on most channels and the sleep timer didn't work.* My girlfriend got really sick after eating a very greasy omelet at Magnolia's.  FWIW I didn't get sick from the food there, but she was pretty tore up and it was the only thing she ate that day."

        "review_text": "Taj DubaiWe travelled as a couple (hence honeymoon!) aged 29/30, during the beginning of April 2017.  We booked this hotel direct through the hotel website in November 2016.There are different room options- Standard room, City view room, Club room, residential suites.We chose the Club Room with the Burj Khalifa view. The price for this was around \u00a31000 for 3 nights, Bed and breakfast.As this was a club room this also included access to the Club Lounge. This lounge included-- complimentary snacks and nibbles throughout the day.- complimentary alcholic/non alcoholic drinks. (No cocktails though! Boo!) during 6.30pm- 8pm only- complimentary afternoon tea- 1 item of clothing pressed each day.First impressionsWe arrived in Dubai on an early morning flight from Manchester. We jumped in a taxi and headed straight to the hotel. The taxi from the airport cost around \u00a310-12.If you have ever been to Dubai, you will know that it is full of high rise buildings, our hotel was of course one of these. We pulled up to the hotel and were greeted by some lovely porters who quickly took our suitcases and welcomed us in to the hotel. There were 3 reception desks which were occupied. So we were asked to take a seat in the lovely lobby area. It was at this point that we looked around. Everywhere was white, with a lovely seating area, and a huge chandelier. Further down the corridor were glass cases housing a range of different Indian themed ornaments. As we sat down we were greeted by another member of staff who was handing out complimentary drinks, this was a rose and mint soft drink, which was very nice! After a few minutes we were then led to one of the reception desks.=Check In===People always say that it is first impressions which count, and the interior of the hotel had lived up to its 5* rating. The receptionist however...we sat down and she got straight into it! No polite chit chat, just asked for our passports straight away. She then asked for a credit card which she could take and hold \u00a3500 on for anything we might spend in the hotel. I did think that \u00a3500 was steep! Anyway, we dont have a credit card so asked if we could use a debit card instead. At this point I think she was just being rude, and said \"no only credit cards\". She then said we could leave a \u00a3500 cash deposit which we could then use in the hotel for meals/room service and receive back whats left at the end. Again, we were not carrying \u00a3500 cash on us! It was as if we had exhausted all of her other options and then she said \"you can pay for your things as you go\". Finally, even if we had a credit card or \u00a3500 cash, paying as we go would be our best option anyway! So that was finally sorted.So we sat waiting to hear about the rest of the information about the hotel...she told us that our room was not ready yet. This was fine as by about this time it was 10am and check in was not until 3pm.  She offered us a cup of tea and said we could have some breakfast if we wished. We both declined as we were feeling tired and just wanted a sit down and rest.  She then said that she would come find us when our room was ready. And that was it. No information about any facilities in the hotel, no directions as to where we were supposed to go and wait. Mr B then asked where our suitcases were as we wanted to get a few bits out while we waited. She said that we could use the spa. She told the porter to take us and our suitcases up to the spa. And then she left.The porter meanwhile was very friendly and asked how we were etc. He then said he would come back for our luggage once we had finished. We headed into the spa, got changed and then headed out to the pool area. The lady on the spa desk was also very friendly. She told us where the sun and shade would be and asked where we would prefer to be. She got us two towels and 2 cold bottles of water. She then said if we needed anything she would be there.It turned around 11.30am and we saw the receptionist heading over to us. She gave us our room keys and said our room was ready. And then she left.So we headed off to explore our room!Mr B says- \"Ok\"Im going to give this receptionist the benefit of the doubt and just presume that she was having a bad day. But a smile does go a long way!Pictures of Taj Dubai, DubaiTaj Dubai, Dubai 20170410_203449 - Taj Dubai, DubaiTaj Dubai, DubaiTaj Dubai, Dubai 20170410_203449 - Taj Dubai, DubaiTaj Dubai, Dubai 20170410_203018 - Taj Dubai, DubaiTaj Dubai, Dubai 20170410_175832 - Taj Dubai, DubaiTaj Dubai, Dubai 20170410_162119 - Taj Dubai, DubaiThe Club RoomWe were on the 25th floor, so we headed into the lift. When we reached our floor. It was a lovely hallway with pictures on the walls and some ornaments. To enter the room you had to  scan your key card over the electronic pad.As you walk in the room, on the left was the entry way, this had a shelf, coat hangers, ironing board and drawers. In one drawer was the iron and another the safe. The safe was free and simple to use.  Walking further into the room there was another door on the left. Walking through this leads you to the bathroom.The BathroomUsually i wouldnt do a separate subheading for a bathroom but I think this one deserves it! In the bathroom and to the left was another door, opening this lead you into a walk-in shower, with both a shower head and a large rainshower. It also had some small shelves in there filled with Molton Brown products.Through the next door was the toilet and bidet. Important to say that it was all very clean with plenty of toilet roll!In the main part of the bathroom was 2 sinks, with more complimentary prouducts, soaps, razors, toothbrushes, bottled water etc. And then the main attraction of the bathroom- the bath! With a large window which looks out onto the amazing view!This really was a fantastic bathroom and we couldnt ask for more from a bathroom! It was thoroughly cleaned each day with plenty of towels, face cloths. There was also 2 dressing gowns hanging up.I do love a good bathroom!Ok back to the rest of the room!As you walk past the room, there is a large cupboard. This is the mini-bar! It was stocked with drinks, nibbles, snacks etc. And the bar menu with all of the prices on. Dubai is an expensive city so things like this are also going to be expensive.  We didnt use anything out of the mini bar. But the good thing about this was that there was space for your own products to go. Such as the cheesecake that we bought back to the hotel after visiting the cheesecake factory!Further we go into the room. On the left is the huge bed, with a range of coloured pillows on. A futon at the end of the bed. 2 bedside cabinets. To the right there is a large flatscreen TV. Walking a little further past the bed and on the left there is a sofa with a small table alongside it. And to the right is a large mirror and shelving unit with a large comfy chair. There was also a digital photo frame which told you all of the different restaurants and times you could visit them! I think this was a super idea!So then the next and final feature of this room. I have definitely saved the best til last! It even beats the bathtub!The ViewThe phrase \"a picture can tell a thousand words\" has never been more apt. And i could easily write a thousand words on it..or you could look at my photographs and see for yourself! One word- Spectacular!*For your information- The Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world! Situated next to this is Dubai Mall, the biggest mall in the world! To the front of the mall is the fountain display and yes you guessed it the biggest (well  almost! The 2nd!) But I think it is the best fountain show in the world!And all this was the view from our floor to ceiling window! Amazing!Extra Room Info- There was plenty of plug sockets (UK sockets) and in convenient locations!- There was a hairdryer in the room.- The bed was very comfortable!- All of the light switches were electronic switches. (Very easy to use!)- A newspaper was left hanging on the door each day.- The TV had a range of channels- from camel racing to Eastenders!After we had been out for the evening, we came back to our room to find a bowl of fruit and 2 cupcakes, with the words happy honeymoon on. And the bed all covered in rose petals! I think that it is these personal touches that turns a 4* hotel into a 5* hotel.Mr B says- \"Amazing!\" \"Amazing view!\"Pool AreaWe first saw the pool area when we arrived. There were plenty of sunbeds available and we put this down to it still being early in the morning. On our second and further visits to the pool area it was lovely to see that there were still plenty of sunbeds available throughout the day.The pool area is situated on two levels. On the main area is the swimming pool, the bar, a large chess game, plenty of sunbeds and a seating area.  The sunbeds are all very comfortable and there are single beds and double beds available. Some with umbrellas, some with curtains.The pool is not the biggest pool I have been in nor the smallest. It is not deep and at 5\"1 (and a bit more) I could stand up in it throughout. The deepest it got for me was up to my shoulders. This does make it hard to swim in though, so if you are after doing 50 lengths each morning this hotel may not be for you! There is also a swim up bar, although we never saw anyone using this! I think the main purpose of this pool is to cool off after baking in the sun!The bar serves a range of drinks from 11am, it is also possible to order food from here, we saw pizzas and burgers being ordered, but we didnt order anything from here ourselves.  The pool attendants are very friendly and quickly hand out your towels to you and some complimentary bottles of water. They even came round one day with cold face cloths!Down some stairs leads you to the next level of the pool area. Here you will find plenty more sunbeds and seating areas, along with a lagoon style water area. This was somewhere to sit and put your feet into the water whilst watching the water fall from the pool above. It was a lovely area to sunbathe.  From this area you can also have another fantastic view of the Burj Khalifa.  It is important to remember that as Dubai is surrounded by tall buildings, the sun is not out all day. However we did well to find a good spot where the sun would be out until 2.30pm! It was actually a god send when it went behind the buildings!Mr B says- \"Nice and relaxed\"RestaurantsThe hotel had 4 different restaurants. These were--The Eloquent Elephant- Bombay Brasserie-Tesoro- Tree house(You could also order snacks from around the pool area, we never used this but did see people having burgers and pizza).The Eloquent ElephantWe came here on our first day for lunch. Mr B had previously read lots of good reviews about this one so we decided to try it. It is located  on the ground floor of the hotel, you walk to the opposite end of the lobby area, past the function room and then there was a board with all of the different opening times. It generally opended at 3pm apart from a Saturday which was 12pm.As you walk through the door it might seem like you have gone the wrong way as the first things you see are the kitchen area and the till. Fear not, and keep walking as you soon see the bar and tables.  It has a very relaxed atmosphere, very grey with fashionable lightbulb lighting. There was no views from this one so all the windows are covered. It seemed to me to be a fashionable chilled out place. There was only a couple of people in here at the time so we had plenty of seats sto choose from. We sat around the corner, so Mr B could see the large flat screen TV which shows \"All Live Sporting Events\" (but not the Grand National!).The waitor was very friendly and came over with our drinks and food menus. He also told us that the special was a roast beef dinner! There were drinks offers on from 3pm-7pm, and with Dubai being an expensive country we were pleased to see this! A pint of beer cost around \u00a36.50 in happy hour and would usually be \u00a311! So definately make the most of happy hours! Mr B did say it was a lovely pint though!The food menu wasnt a massive selection of food but there was enough of a choice.  It was mainly English dishes here such as Sausage and Mash (warning it contains pork!), Fish and Chips, Roast dinners etc. I opted for the Sausage and Mash and Mr B went for the Burger.  They were both delicious! There were 3 sausages on the smoothest mash! A little veg and the nicest onion gravy! Mr B really enjoyed his burger which had cheese, lettuce and tomatoes on. It was a very generous size!We both really enjoyed our meals and the laid back style to this restuarant! We visited this restuarant again on our last night and had a late lunch.  I went for the fish and chips, again delicious! And Mr B went for a different burger which had Bacon, cheese and onion rings on! He again very much enjoyed this! If you are planning a trip to this hotel i would definately recommend a visit here!Bombay BrasserieWe visited here for our evening meal one night. This was a traditional Indian restuarant.  We hadnt reserved a table but there were some free. The ones with a view of the Burj Khalifa were all taken, no suprises there! There was also seats around the cooking  station, and another quieter area. We sat in the quieter area. The decor of this restuarant was all very traditional which I loved. I sometimes think that some places try to mix the modern with traditional and it doesnt work, so keeping it all traditional definately worked.The staff here were again very friendly and couldnt do enough to help you. I ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala and the waitor asked if I wanted it spicy. I said a little bit and when it came it was just perfect! The food, drinks and service here was fantastic and it is also a place I would definately recommend!TesoroAs we went bed and breakfast this is where breakfast is served. There are seating options both inside and outside, during our stay we sat in both, so if you have the chance definitely  sit outside, it has gorgeous views.  It is a standard hotel style buffet breakfast with lots of choice! Cereals, croissants, inidian foods, pancakes etc. There is also a menu on the table where you can order eggs to be cooked how you like them, we ordered the fried eggs. The food again was lovely, the service quick and friendly, and the interoir was nice. We went for breakfast about 9am and it was busy but we didnt have to wait for a table.I always like the idea of going bed and breakfasts as its one meal you dont have to think about. It was a lovely kick start to the day!This restuarant also served evening meals, we didnt eat here at an evening but you did have to walk though here to get to the Treehouse bar, on both occasions we walked through it was quiet.TreehouseThis is one of the more picturesque bars in this hotel. Set on the 3rd floor, outside, overlooking Dubai at night, amazing cocktails, soft music in the background. Perfect. Need I say more? (I probably dont...but I will!)There was plenty of seating options here, or you could stand at the bar. This seemed to be a bar that people would visit who were not staying in the hotel and I can see why they like to come here! I think that before I came to Dubai this is what I imagined! And it lived upto its expectations! We didnt eat in this bar but there was a food menu, again not a large menu but enough.If out of the 3 restaurants you can only visit one, then I would say go for this one!Mr B says- \"Good Food\"The Club LoungeAs we had booked a club room we had access to the club lounge. This was a lounge dedicated only to Club guests. It was situated on the 24th floor. As we walked in we were greeted by some lovely staff members who showed us around and told us what we could find.  There was lots of seating areas, some complimentary nibbles and snacks, and floor to ceiling windows of the amazing views of Dubai fountains and the Burj Khalifa. During the day there was a complimentary afternoon tea and during the times 6.30pm-8pm there were complimentary alcoholic drinks. No suprises as to what times we went there! There was some branded spirits, beers and wines. The staff in here were very friendly and very knowledgeable about Dubai and the history of Dubai, this was lovely to hear about.  Each night we sat by the window and watched the fountains, it was a beautiful setting. If we were going to stay at this hotel again we would opt for this option as it all adds to your luxury Dubai trip.Mr B says- \"nice\"LocationOne of the deciding factors when booking this hotel was the location. Did we want to be near the beach? Or nearer the Mall? It was a hard choice! But Im glad to say I am pretty sure we made the right one!This hotel was about 20minutes from the airport. (The beach ones would have been about 40minutes).This hotel offered a free shuttle bus to Dubai Mall, it ran on the hour from 11am through to 8pm. The return journey was then at 12.15 each hour with the last one being 8.45pm.  It was based on a first come, gets on, situation. When we used it there was still a few seats empty. It only took around 5minutes to get there. It was ideal. Its also important to say that there are many taxis waiting outside the hotel for you so this could also be another option. We got a taxi back from the mall to the hotel and it only cost us around \u00a33.I love a beach, which is why choosing this hotel which was not near a beach was hard! However we asked at reception where the nearest beach was. The closest was Kite Beach. Around 20minutes away. And there was Jameira public beach, around 35minutes away.  Apparently at the Jameira beach there are plenty of restaurants, sunbeds, towels, umbrellas etc. Where at Kite beach you take your own things. We opted for Kite beach. We stayed here for a couple of hours, walked down to the Burj al arab (7*hotel), quick dip in the sea, dried off, quick drink and back in the taxi. The reason why I think we made the best decision with our hotel is because it is sooo hot at the beach! We couldnt last any longer than what we were there for! There seems to be plenty more things to do if you stay nearer the city centre than nearer the beach. And with a taxi only costing around \u00a310 to the beach, our one trip was more than enough!Mr B says- \"very good location\"Check OutSo it was our time to leave! 3 amazing nights in Dubai! We had an early flight to catch so needed a taxi for 5.30am, we checked at reception and they said that there would be taxis available. They said that if we rang down a few minutes before they would have one ready and waiting for us to get in! They also said when we rang they would send someone for our luggage but we could easily manage this ourselves. As soon as we got down the lift they quickly took our luggage off us, got a taxi ready, and loaded our cases! All we had to do then was hand in our room key! And because we had paid for everything as we went we had no bills or anything to pay! So in the taxi and back to the airport!Mr B says- \"Quick and efficent\" (He actually said \"fast and easy\" but I thought that one needed re-wording!)OverallI could not recommend this hotel enough! Everything was perfect and we had an amazing stay! We only wished we had stayed longer! Dubai is a fantastic city with plenty to see and do! This hotel added to the luxury of our stay and was well worth the money we spent, it was our honeymoon afterall! If you plan to come to Dubai I would say save up as much money as you can, as you want to be able to enjoyyour stay without thinking about your \"credit card\" bill when you get home!We were sad to leave this hotel, but knowing that our next flight was to Bali, for part 2 of our honeymoon definately made it easier!Mr B says- \"5*\""

        "review_text": "When planning a trip, I always check reviews, and I\u2019m happy I selected La Flora based on the reviews I read on Tripadvisor. Every staff person I came in contact with was pleasant and professional from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. The hotel is in a central location and one short block from the beach. The room was clean and bright, and I felt safe and well cared for during my stay.The room rate included a continental breakfast, which we found extremely convenient and cost effective. It included boiled eggs, bagels, fruit, yogurt, cheese, cereal, pastries, orange juice, coffee and milk. There was something for everyone.For a $10 \u201cresort\u201d fee per room, you receive one beach towel per person, cold bottled water whenever you ask, and unlimited free drinks during a 5pm-6pm happy hour. The bartender was very nice, as well. The free WiFi was just as good as any free WiFi I have used in other hotels. I think $10 is an amazing deal for two people!We also asked about the availability of beach chairs and an umbrella. They were able to provide them as past customers purchased them, then left them behind. Ours were in excellent condition and we were happy they were available.The cleaning staff was respectful and always cheery, and the General Manager, Ros, was very friendly and always available to assist if needed.We did not rent a car, and used Uber and Lyft  to and from the airport, and also to Key Biscayne for a day trip. Both Uber and Lyft, proved to be much cheaper and nicer than taxi\u2019s and no hassle. It worked perfectly for us.We met some lovely international guests; a couple with two teenage daughters from Germany, two newly married couples from Italy, and another couple with a teenage son from Germany. They all were friendly and seemed happy to be there.With regards to the clientele, one encounter impressed me the most. While we were enjoying a happy hour drink on the terrace, a mature couple who were also having a drink, asked if the two chairs near us were available. We said of course please join us and, through our conversation, we learned that the gentleman was the past CEO of a very large Finnish bank. Clearly, they could have their pick of any place to stay in Miami, yet they recognized the value of this small boutique hotel. In my book, the QPR (Quality Price Ratio) just can\u2019t be beat."

        "review_text": "Their only swimming pool was small but exquisite. If you are with the kinds, you would enjoy it but if you are looking for a quiet relaxing time lounging by the pool with cocktails, you will be very disappointed as it just becomes kinds pool during the holiday seasons.We understand that it was one of the busiest time when many Japanese celebrities and their families stay there so the guest relations are fully occupied for VIPs. Bell boys never recognize our faces and we often were asked if we were checking in when we drove back to the hotel during our 8(eight) days of our stay(we used valet parking 2-3/day and of course tipped them normally). We have stayed at several resorts in many countries that make you feel like you are home and so welcomed. Obviously this hotel was not one of them.Service at the Wailou was terrible. Very slow and food was cold as they seemed like they were shorthanded.It\u2019s a shame that our experience with Trump was not as expected. Maybe we were probably at the wrong hotel at the wrong timing."

        "review_text": "Here for a 5 night stay to celebrate birthday. Upon check-in, they did acknowledge my platinum elite status and birthday celebration. However, there is no offer of any complimentary upgrades. There is no lounge access but instead provided $15 vouchers per person  per night. They said that the executive level \u201clounge\u201d is only available to guests staying at those level and not for any platinum members. My marriott profile has high floor listed as a preference. They gave me a room on the 9th floor (out of 16) and told me that it is a high floor.The $15 per person voucher barely covers the cost of an entree as half of the breakfast entrees are over $15. There is also this confusing line item added as a service charge which was explained to me as something internal between the hotel and servers whenever vouchers are used and is normally taken off the total cost of bill. But do double check to make sure it is not included as part of the total due. My recent stay at an autograph collection hotel in Miami (Turnberry Isle), free breakfast is actually \u201cfree\u201d - includes beverages and tax gratuity is included. In this case, these vouchers are merely discounts. The one good thing is that you can use these vouchers for breakfast, lunch, or dinner but no alcoholic beverages. You just have to use it on the specific date listed on the voucher. The platinum arrival gift of $10 can be used during the stay and on alcohol.Don\u2019t expect any freebies from hotel for birthday. No acknowledgement or anything. But that\u2019s okay... I didn\u2019t even bother to say anything.Valet parking per day is $35 plus tax. What they called \u201cdestination fee\u201d is another $25 per day. Essentially what you are paying is the E Komo Mai basket, pool towels, and daily shaved ice. There are other daily poolside delights listed as perks, but they are often unavailable. I waited for the drink sample one day but was told they are not ready... I approached the front desk about it and they said they will bring it up to the food and beverage manager. The day before, the frozen fruit bites was a no show either. Don\u2019t list amenities as part of the reason for this daily destination fee but then fail to deliver.Now despite these short comings, I do love the location of this hotel and proximity to great restaurants and shopping. The starbucks reserve and kona coffee purveyor is just a block away and the beach is a quick 5 mins walk. The valet attendants as well as the staff and servers are all really nice and attentive. The housekeeping service is efficient. The management just need to up the level if they want to entice ritz carlton/marriott/spg members to pick this hotel when visiting oahu."

(Did not use the bar so don't have pricing information.Hotel room is as most other US rooms and was clean.Room rates are in my opinion far behind recognition, but all hotels in SFO are over priced.From the airport to the hotel will take you approximately 20 minutes by car.Tip: to save money, take a Uber from the airport to the hotel. Approx $25 for the ride incl. a bottle of water. If you have a rental car, parking at the hotel will cost you $65 excl. taxes per 24hours!!!"

        "review_text": "Hotel was comfortable. Only interacted with the staff for check-in.My grievance is the $30 per night charge *after* my stay for an \"urban retreat fee.\"I have no idea what I got for that charge, and was not made aware of it when checking in. Why make this charge after the stay instead of before? This tactic has tarnished the hotel's reputation for me.I can't imagine a single customer who would want to pay for their room in two installments! It makes absolutely no sense other than to frustrate patrons. I created a TripAdvisor account just to shame this scheme.I was told on the phone this had something to do with a booking app \u2014 I know nothing about this as the room was booked by my client while visiting for work.After emailing my complaint I was refunded only $30 of the $90 penalty.Stay somewhere else with honest billing."

        "review_text": "Hawaii is a great place with such friendly people, aloha spirit, and always the attitude to go out of their way to help you have a great time. But not at this Hilton and definitely not the lady who we checked in with.I am a Hilton honors gold member via Amex and this is my first booking with a Hilton. I am a high status member of both starwood and Marriott. I always stay at these two chains for both work and leisure, it may be 100+ days a year! I have always been given a room upgrade if available, early check ins and late checkouts guaranteed, and a free breakfast.But on landing at this Hilton after a 15 hr flight from Asia, I was greeted badly by a receptionist and she refused to attach my honors number to the reservation even when Hilton support had explicitly told me they can do it at the hotel when I check in. So she also refused to give me even a room upgrade when I requested saying I do not need my points or any other benefit. She made us wait 2 hours to give a room on the 6th floor facing the city and the all the noise from the roads below saying there were no other higher floor rooms available in a 35 floor hotel. So I didn't argue, got my room, called the manager and he immediately upgraded me to a high floor ocean facing room without me even having to explain anything!I can't believe the reception desk could be so stingy and mean when rooms were so well available, to a Honors gold member, after requesting many times, just because probably I landed there after a 15hr flight and a backpacking trip looking all deshelved and poor? Or I do not know why I was shown such attitude.I have made one more reservation at Hilton double tree coming up tomorrow booked through their own site. If I am not treated well, I am never again going to stay at a Hilton and better stick to my Starwoods and Marriott rewards programs. These guys don't deserve my business I feel."

        "review_text": "Now owned by Diamond Properties - should be Wood Properties ?We have stayed at the Modern for several years over Thanksgiving and have referred many, many friends to stay there.Yesterday - we arrived at 1030 am and were told that our suite with marina view was not ready = no big deal - checkout is noon.  So off to the 'cool' pool. Service at pool - poached eggs = hard boiled, waiter vanished for 30 minutes at one point , pool - not clean - the metal bars had sunscreen slime on them at 11AM , scavenger birds everywhere, dining seats wet, towels at pool smelly too. Servers in the pool/ towel, restaurant and drink service areas - not there mentally or physically. Staff = all talking about their weekends etc but not helping guests or looking at their phones.12:30 - went to check on our pre-paid $600/nite room after 2 hours and again 3 hours and the same excuse - house keeping - blah blah blah.Eventually waited at the frontdesk area with our 4 y/o failing asleep in a small chair next to the marketing department / timeshare sale crew - would they get it and step up service ? - \"do you Vacation a lot ? - you should consider a timeshare with Diamond\"...ahh I don't think you have a room or a successful business here dude.After speaking with 7 employees - no compassion and after 4 hours of waiting for a room - a lady with her name badge upside down and her eye makeup to the sky - snapped at me in front of her trainee co-worker and said - \"well we can just downgrade your room - that's what you want me to do ?\" ..... I said - \" no we will wait\"  but felt so hurt. I am 54 not 16 years old lady and have earned this vacation and run a multi-million dollar company.Next while still waiting a \"Jordan\" came over to us and said - \" check-in is a 3pm and you will have to wait till we have your room ready- get it ? \"So done - \"bye Felicia\" ..we went to another hotel and called hotels.com to report / cancel / move-on.We are so sad - because this is such a great location - but vacations are about relaxation and friendly people (especially in Hawaii).  No thank You Diamond Properties and your lost staff ... (demoralized or under-managed staff ??) - at over $600/ night ???  Oh - yes - we noticed that your salesforce were being trained upstairs too to sell / sell/ sell - really ?Thanks for the (good and now horrid) memories Modern - we are making new ones at a true 5-star hotel for $100/ night less and the staff here mean business and they will have our business again.We hope this is just a transition phase for the Modern - A Diamond resorts Jewel  - but we will not be there again.  No WAY San Jose."

        "review_text": "Spent a marvelous week stay at Hotel Zetta which I dare say is the best boutique hotel in the city.We were made so welcomed at check in by the cheerful Sean and Kristiana (hopefully correct spelling). They not only helped cleared any doubts of our troublesome Expedia booking but also offered us an early checkin after our lengthy 16hrs flight across the Pacific. Even though we didn't get the bed config for the first night, they effortless transferred us to our spacious double queen room the next night.This positive checkin experience carried on throughout our stay and because it's not one of those faceless chain hotels, all the frontline staff made us feel right at home.Now the other superlatives why Hotel Zetta is No.1.1) Location - Right on busy Market Street adjoining busy and modern Westfield Mall and across from Union Square and the Cable Car turnabout. Excellent shopping and numerous dining options for all budgets in the mall and Union Sq vicinity. Because of its location, we felt pretty safe hanging out late and will not bother by the few homeless that you will encounter throughout the city - just walk on by without eye contact or engaging them.Public transport to all major tourist sites readily available on either Market or Mission street. Download the highly accurate 511 Transit app on your phone for accurate bus arrival since some buses do not run too frequently.2) Modern hotel where everything works unlike so many aging hotels in the city. The ample bedroom and bathroom spaces easily fit our family of four.3) Active lobby bar and the priceless game space on the 2nd floor. My teens and ourselves spent hours in the evening bonding over pool, table tennis and board games in the relaxing game area whilst enjoying ice cream treats from the nearby Ghiradelli ice cream parlor or Walgreen convenience shop/pharmacy.4) Innovative green friendly hotel - equipped with latest tech gadgets and effective basic wifi (not all rooms though). We made us of the green offer of daily $10 mini bar or faster wifi access by forgoing a few days room cleaning. You won't miss a thing as the bathrooms are well stocked with big bottles of toiletries.Finally, if you are looking for a conveniently located, spacious, modern hotel with lots of entertainment for the family and topped off with friendly and genuinely cheerful service - stay at Hotel Zetta."

        "review_text": "I want to be clear - 90% of this hotel is great to stay at.  The staff are friendly and fun, the lobby & location are great, the rooms while not top of the line are generally clean and tidily appointed.  I have even stayed there before quite happily, so when I was coming back to Seattle for work I thought hey, I know where to go and it'll be easy and awesome.  But, and here's the big but that takes that 90% awesome and makes it a buyer beware, I stayed there on Tuesday night 6/9/2015 and there were bedbugs.  I went to bed happy as a clam, woke up in the morning with little red bumps all over my torso.  Just thinking it was a bit of a reaction to the perfumes or soaps I was annoyed but in a hurry so didn't take the time to address it.  Very quickly those little red bumps became large itchy (37 of which I can count on my frontside, backside is bitten as well but unknown count since I'm only so flexible) welts the google imaging of which absolutely confirmed bedbug bites.So now my work travel case & contents are all being quarantined and fumigated in the garage so they can be ready to travel again next week and I am both miserable and itchy.  I called the hotel last night and let them know, and they apologized basically saying that housekeeping do the best they can but know things happen.  I'm sorry, but this isn't 'Things happen.'  Like oops, we forgot to refresh your shampoo.  This is more in the line of your guests will never ever come back and make sure no one they know suffers similarly."

        "review_text": "I might have a biased opinion since I was here on a \"timeshare presentation.\" The hotel itself, especially the suite we stayed in was absolutely lovely. There's a kitchen with microwave, stove and dishwasher with all the utensils, plates and silverware you  need to fix meals. The view from the suite sucked since it was facing the wall of the Cosmopolitan (although in the time share presentation -once you're a member-you can ask for the best suite which has an awesome view of the Bellagio which is on the other side of the Cosmopolitan).The hotel, staff and cleanliness was excellent. What I want folks to know are \"secrets\" they don't tell you that it's nice to know before hand so you can be prepared and enjoy your visit in Vegas especially since the Jockey Club is right in the center strip next to all the other major casinos.PARKING: The parking for the Jockey Club is in the basement of the Cosmo on level B3. The easiest way to enter is by driving west on Harmon and crossing the Strip (Las Vegas Blvd.) and entering the Cosmo following the sign for self-park to level B3. Just spiral down to B3 and then drive straight ahead to about the middle of the building and turn left. There are signs saying \"valet\" on B3 but you can continue through and then you'll see the elevator for the Jockey Club. Once you check in, they'll give you a voucher ticket to put on your dash.SWIMMING POOLS: The swimming pool at the JC only has a few hours of precious sunlight hitting the pool are before it's gone because the Cosmopolitan blocks the sunlight after a certain time (sorry can't give you specifics). What we weren't told and found out later is that you can use your room key-you'll need that to go to the pool which provided towels for you to use and has a dry heat sauna!-to use the pool at the Cosmo. The Cosmo's pool is at the top of the building and gets way more sunlight.ENTRANCE/EXIT TO CASINO AND OUTSIDE: We saw that there was a place where Ubers, Lyfts and cabs would come to pick or drop people off so we didn't pay much mind to it but on our last day we wish we had because the only way to get in/out of the JC-or so we thought-was to use the elevator which takes you up to the Cosmo. So there are different ways to get in and out of the Cosmo but only 1 elevator that takes you down to the JC. There's another entrance by the side alley way behind the fence. When you're leaving the JC, you have to pass by the place where the Ubers, Lyft, etc are at to p/u-drop off people. Instead of going up the elevator which takes you to the Cosmo casino, you can follow the road where the cars come from and there's walkway to the strip. As you read this it may not make sense but once you walk it you'll see what I'm talking about. This was you don't have to walk thru Cosmo and take elevator.These are just some tips that I found while I was there that I hope be useful for others so they can enjoy their stay to the max!"

Iincluding the lounge that, despite its reduced size, offers what you would expect, specially for breakfast. The tiny croissants are excellent. Guess though that some actions have to be taken for the tub, too low and of a limited capacity, in which you cannot have a bath unless you wanna spill all the water over. TV set is small and offers only few digital channels, many analog channels display poor quality on the screen. Thus entertainment is very limited and not good for your eyes."

I got it!  David gave us (me and my husband) an end room on the 12th floor.  We had a view of Diamond Head and the beach.  We ate breakfast every morning on our balcony looking at both.  The hotel is at the south end of Waikiki beach and next to the zoo. Both views were unobstructed. We walked about 300 feet from the hotel to the Pacific ocean.  The beach at the south end has a short pier with a breaker wall.  As a result, a large ocean-water pool is created.  It is great!  There are no waves and so the swimming is exceptional.  In the room we had 2 beds, a dresser, a desk, a fridge, and a coffee maker. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean.  The only thing I could wish for would be about 20% more space in the room and bathroom, but the location and the service made up for that.  You have to pay for parking at all Waikiki hotels."

        "review_text": "Recently booked 2 apartment rooms at this hotel for a family vacation. Arrived at the hotel around 3am very tired after a long haul flight. Expected a smooth and seamless check-in process so we could get some rest, especially at this time of the night. Instead, what we got was one of the worst check-in experiences we have ever encountered at a hotel.Zidan, the check-in assistant, demanded that we hand over a deposit of AED 2000, despite it not saying anywhere on our paperwork that a deposit is required. We politely pointed this out and explained that we would not be leaving a deposit as we would not be making any in-room purchased and wanted the minibar removed and any purchases that we happened to make within the hotel we would settle directly at the point of sale. Many of the leading hotels around the world do not require you to leave a deposit at the time of check-in if you inform them that you do not require in-room services. Our response was met with unexpected resistance with Zidan telling us that a deposit is required as part of 'hotel policy' and demanding that we hand over additional cash to him without it being accounted for anywhere. We were extremely disappointed by this and his attitude. We asked to speak to the Manager, to which Zidan replied \"I am the Manager\", which was not only false but a very poor response lacking any degree of customer service. That is not the kind of response or service we would expect to receive as guests of the hotel. When we pressed harder to speak to the Duty Manager finally he relented and called his colleague Ahmed. When we explained the situation to Ahmed he understood matters and quickly agreed that no deposit was required and apologised for demanding this from us.What an awful check-in experience in the middle of the night after a long haul flight and us feeling tired and disheveled. We would suggest that training is given to front desk reception staff on how to uphold the highest levels of customer service and how to welcome guests to the hotel properly, not demand that they hand over more money that isn't required or documented anywhere.Another disappointing aspect of our stay was the driveway outside the hotel. Inconsiderate drivers are routinely driving into the driveway, stopping there and blocking the traffic from behind. The concierge team really need to get their finger out and do their job properly to ensure that the traffic remains free-flowing on the driveway. On one occasion we, along with 5 other vehicles, had to wait 20 minutes for an inconsiderate driver to move out the way and clear the driveway. The concierge team had the audacity to unload the driver's luggage and keep us all waiting 20 minutes in our vehicles instead of telling the driver to move his vehicle to the side so that we could all get past. We complained about this and were told it would be fed back to the management however the problem continues to persist. It's a totally rubbish and frustrating system.Aside from this, the rooms were nice, clean and well-equipped. Probably it is the only best thing about this hotel along with its proximity to the metro station. The swimming pool is a bit small. The complimentary kawa is a bit hit and miss and inconsistent - sometimes it is there, sometimes it is not. We should think that this should be provided at all times in the lobby.The staff could do with training on customer service as this is clearly lacking for a lot of them and no apology was given by the hotel for the unpleasant issues we encountered during our stay."

        "review_text": "If you want a beautiful, relaxing & well appointed hotel DO NOT STAY HERE. We have been here for almost a week & it\u2019s been like living on a building site. They drag trolleys around from 4.30am setting up for conferences & weddings, which is a daily occurrence. The house keeping staff make sure you are up bright and early, just what you want on a holiday. By 7.30am they are knocking on your door & vacuuming outside your room. The rooms are dirty & on several occasions they didn\u2019t even attended to our sons room. Who knows what they are vacuuming! I must admit the sheer lack of service started from the moment we arrived. It was almost midnight when we pulled up outside, a family of 4 with 7 bags (been skiing first!) No help from the bell desk, in fact they just watched us drag our bags up the stairs until they eventually came when I fell down a step with a bag. On check in there wasn\u2019t any \u201choliday\u201d welcome. Didn\u2019t get a lay, apparently you have to be a different nationality here to get any form of service. When we got to our room we were happy. Nice big bed, rooms are small but we could manage. Then on closer inspection there was dust & dirt over every surface. The toilet smelt like it hadn\u2019t been cleaned in a very long time. Close to an hour later we still hadn\u2019t gotten our bags. My youngest son is 12 & we were all in need of a shower & some sleep after traveling all day. In the end my husband had to go & track down our bags & literally beg to get them to our rooms. The beach chair arrangement is a joke, as well as a so called private beach which as guests you have to pay for. One pool attendant spent a morning chasing my sons around constantly telling them off. Accusing them of running & diving, which is completely untrue as we were watching them. I\u2019m disgusted that they treated them in this way, they are paying guests after all,just because they are young westerners. We chose to sit on the free unattended beach after which is a much better option! We aren\u2019t usually people who complain but we did bring these matters to the front desk to get absolutely nothing in response. They just looked through us, did not care at all.I would never recommend this hotel. Yes it\u2019s very pretty from the outside & the lobby is quaint but that\u2019s truly where it ends. Terrible service, unfriendly staff & extremely poor quality. Certainly not worth anywhere near the money we paid."

I sent one email to the reservations email address and within minutes my reservation was cancelled and my credit card wasn't charged.  I think they were able to do that since it was just a couple hours since I reserved it but still, they didn't have to do that.  I talked to their Reservation Coordinator on the phone to confirm and he said he took care of it and if anything gets charged, call him personally and it'll be fixed.  Great customer service!"

        "review_text": "This has to be the worst place I ever stayed in my life.Parking is an additional $25.00 and the place is a dump.  They only have  about 15 spaces that are very close.  When spaces or taken you have to park 2 to 3 blocks away for $20.00.  Jacuzzi was broken might as well sit in a hot tub...oh yea no tub only step up shower.Required to leave a $50.00 deposit for DVD's and we only got one.  When checking out we asked to have some of deposit returned and they said it was a service charge.  WTH service charge for what only service was typical like getting room cleaned.  No elevators and kitchen was not updated.  Towels were not clean.   TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE."

        "review_text": "This review was originally posted on my blog: http://onesleepymommy.weebly.com/home/hotel-review-the-equus-hotel-oahu-hawaiiI had the opportunity to visit a place some people call paradise on earth. Hawaii is definitely beautiful from the air, and even more so on the ground. Oahu, being one of many islands of Hawaii, offers a balanced mix of city life and rugged countryside. This time I, my husband, and my toddler stayed in The Equus Hotel; a charming boutique hotel on Waikiki\u2019s Upper West Side.We were greeted with Aloha from every member of the staff. Upon check in, we were served refreshing chilled fresh juice. The check in process was fast. After signing some forms, I was given the key to the room and we got a beautiful lei made of shells as a souvenir.I enjoyed the theme of the hotel. The name \u201cEquus\u201d is derived from the word \u201cequestrian\u201d, which is featuring horseback riding. Equus Hotel is keeping true to the theme with Ralph Lauren-inspired details throughout.What we love about Equus Hotel:Strategically locatedThe hotel is close to Ala Moana Center, the largest open air mall in world. It took us less than 10 minutes walk to the mall. It is also close enough to the center of Waikiki where you can swim in the ocean, wine and dine under the stars, or just stroll around the stores. It is nice to be able to go to places within walking distance. My toddler enjoyed the walk and she was happy she was not stuck in a car.Energy efficientI liked this display on the reception desk that shows how to turn on the AC in the guest room. You need to insert your room key to a slot in the wall in order for the AC to run. The AC will be turned off when you remove the room key from the slot and leave the room. This is a great initiative to save energy.Sealed toiletriesAnother great initiative by Equus Hotel is their biodegradable earth-friendly amenities. I am impressed that they seal the toiletries bottles to ensure they are new and never been used. The leftover toiletries are donated to shelters and recycled into other products.Unique detailsEquus Hotel put details in the guest room that I didn\u2019t find in other hotels. The staff artfully folded some towels into animal shapes. This is great for entertaining little kids. My toddler had a good time holding the \u201cduck\u201d and pointing at the \u201cswan.\u201d It put a smile on my face the moment I entered the room and saw these cute animal shaped towels.Popular brewing techAnother nice surprise was the Keurig mini brewing system in every room. It is so easy to use. You can bring your favorite K-cup pod and brew it in the comfort of your room! To satisfy your sweet tooth, they provide you mini cookies to go with your coffee or tea. Or you can share the cookies with your little ones. They always appreciate sweets.Towels, towels, and more towelsI stayed at many hotels before, and a couple of times I had to call the housekeeping and asked for extra towels. But at Equus Hotel, that didn\u2019t happen. They provide the guests with plenty of towels. There were probably 16 towels with various sizes in the room that we stayed in. Those are great if you stay with little kids, as \u201cmessy\u201d is their middle name.Affordable in-room diningWhen I stay in a hotel, I am always curious about their in-room dining. I rarely order any food from hotel because their price is usually astronomical ($25 for a simple breakfast, anyone?). Here at Equus Hotel, the in-room dining price is very reasonable. They are even cheaper than some restaurants outside of the hotel. So, the next time your little ones get hungry and ask for a meal, or if you want to snack on something, you don\u2019t have to feel guilty when you order from their menu.CribThey do provide a crib. Just ask, and they will set it up for you. Now, don\u2019t think about a crib with metal bars and curved tops. It is a simple travel crib. The kind that you see in baby store. It does the job and helped my toddler to get the rest she needed.Text for anythingI love to text. I text more than I call. When I learned that Equus Hotel has a number that you can text when you need anything during your stay at the hotel, I was all over it! I had to wait for the crib, so I texted them that I hadn\u2019t gotten the crib set up yet. Within seconds, they responded. It keeps the communication going between guests and the staff. You can also send them a text and ask them about things to do around the island, even when you are not in the hotel. I love this feature a lot.Deal packagesEquus Hotel offers several deals, e.g. business deal, advance booking deal, per diem deal, and fashionista deal. Check back often because they change the deals every now and then. We stayed with the fashionista package, and the deal was awesome. We got $30 Ala Moana Center giftcard, $20 Uber credits, and many more! Very worth it.What\u2019s more from Equus Hotel:If you travel to Oahu and stay at Equus Hotel during polo seasons in April \u2013 August, you are in for a treat. Equus Hotel offers complimentary transportation to Hawaii Polo Club in North Shore (the world\u2019s only beachfront polo field), free table at the clubhouse, and two complimentary admission tickets to the polo matches. If you love polo, or if you are curious about it, don\u2019t forget to take advantage of this generous offer.Room for improvement:Though I like the \u201chome away from home\u201d coziness of the hotel, there are several areas that can be improved. Some of them are: flat pillows, very basic shower head, small-sized safe that will not fit a laptop.Another drawback is the steep stairs to go to the entrance of the hotel. Although Equus Hotel makes sure all guests know about this situation by mentioning it in the reservation page, I was still surprised by it. If you travel with kids in stroller, you will need to pick up the stroller and go up many steps.Recommended for:After staying at Equus Hotel and reviewing its features, this wonderful boutique hotel would be suitable for:- People who don\u2019t\u2019 mind the stairs.- People who love horses. They can take advantage of the equestrian experience offered and to travel to Hawaii Polo Club in North Shore. Free of charge!- People who travel light.- Tourists who spend a lot of time outside of the hotel. There are so many things to do close to the hotel location."

        "review_text": "I visited San Francisco, with my family, at the beginning of a California road trip. We arrived, jet lagged, from London and there was quite a queue at check-in. It took a little while to get checked in, and I was pretty frustrated\u2026getting myself all but ready for my future gripe on Trip Advisor, but the rest of the stay was so good it turned out to be a minor aberration.This is a lovely, hip hotel with a very lively reception/bar area and in a nice location - not right in Union Square with the crowds, but very close so it was easy to get to all the right places in SF. The rooms are modern, ours were quiet. Because of the hotel's location there aren't any stunning views but don't let that put you off.When we'd checked in, we'd been standing next to a couple who had been unable to get a double room they needed to accommodate their young child with them, so we offered them the one our kids were using, and in return the hotel gave us two single rooms.On checking out, the hotel gave us a gift and a discount as thanks for helping them solve the problem. Honestly, it wasn't necessary, but it surprised and delighted us, and I report it here because it says everything you need to know about how good it was to stay at this hotel."

        "review_text": "I've just returned from San Francisco and am still unhappy when I remember my stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco November 2014.  I had booked a special suite for our family to celebrate my husbands 70th birthday. The suite was booked in August 2014 and we arrived, excited with 3 months of anticipation, and were shown into a suite that looked as if 1/2 the furniture was missing.  Odd we thought.  The bathroom was off too.  We didn't put two and two together until our son arrived and rang the door bell. Alarms went off with piercing shrieks and lights flashed. When we opened the door our son said \"Why did you book a handicap suite?\". Naturally we were upset. This was a special occasion we had planned for 3 months.  Nothing had been mentioned to us.  When we discussed this with the front desk no remedy was offered except a $1500 per night upgrade.  Several requests during the weekend produced no other options.  At check out a concession of $200 per night was granted. We didn't care about that. What we wanted was the \"Four Seasons Experience\" we had anticipated and had experienced during previous stays in Chicago and Maui.When we arrived home I wrote a letter to the general manager, Doug Housley, explaining what had occurred.  His reply was really nothing but a \"sorry\"!I doubt this is the memory Allan Smith, the CEO, had in mind when he said \"your best memories are moments away\" on the Four Season's website."

        "review_text": "This hotel has horrible rooms and front desk services. Our first room smelled like feeces so bad when we opened the door we headed straight back down to the front desk. It was the most rancid smell and I have two young kids I know poopy smells and this wasn\u2019t just an un flushed toilet. The next room smelled horrible too but this was a musty smell. By this point my kids were nagging to go to the pool, which closed at 4 pm for a wedding!! , so we just decided to deal with it. When we came back from the pool and really realized how musty it smelled we complained again. They wanted to give us a new room the next day. Of course by the next day our stuff was all over the room with 4 peoples things to move we decided we wouldn\u2019t move unless they would upgrade us, which they insisted they wouldn\u2019t do. Meanwhile there were 3 towels for a room reservation for 4, the bathroom door was warped and wouldn\u2019t close all the way, the door was a glass material that would wake EVERYONE up at night when anyone turned the light on to use the restroom! I\u2019m writing this reviewing and we haven\u2019t even left the hotel yet from our vacation. Not to mention the wedding kept us up all night on the 11th floor bc the dj was so loud and the base was up so incredibly high it shook the whole room!! So not happy, and we would NEVER stay here again. Yes, it has many extra things like bowling, kids club etc but the rooms are awful and they don\u2019t care about customees being happy!"

I also liked that there was a water fountain thing with lemon or cucumber, which seems to be the norm in american hotels but even so. One of the receptionists which I cannot remember her name (she said she lived in LA then New York beforehand) was very nice and went out of her way to make sure we had a nice time. Although San Fran isn't the best place I have ever been, this hotel made up for it really.  It seemed very busy outside which I could never understand because in the hotel and room it was peaceful, like you weren't in a city at all. Plus I am a very light sleeper and didn't wake up to anything :) t was very central to everything too, no where was that far away. If I ever came back to San Fran, I would stay here again 100%! P.S- I recommend going to Alcatraz!"

The Staff kindly upgraded me upon arrival, the location was very close to the Shops and the Beach.It is the staff that really make the impact though. They refer to you as friends as soon as you walk in, and they are always happy to talk or provide advice on where to go and what to eat. Complimentary breakfast and WiFi is also a huge plus in my books (especially for the low cost in the first place)"

        "review_text": "I was in Miami Beach for a conference, and chose this hotel due to it's location between the office, and the beach.  I stayed in room 213, Tuesday April 14th to Friday April 17th.The Good:-The location is excellent, just a few blocks from the beach, and Ocean Drive.  Close enough to enjoy the sights and sounds of South Beach, but far enough away from the hustle and bustle and the noise that goes with it.The Not so Good:-I guess it is personal preference, but the bed was hard, and the pillows were soft.  The bed did not have springs, but sat on a platform, which made it even harder.  I used three pillows stacked on top of each other.-The room was clean, except that there was mold in the shower.-While the room was large enough, it would not be very private to share with another person.  The sink is in the room with the bed, and the shower door opens into the bedroom as well.  The toilet luckily does have a door.-There is a window in the shower that does not have a blind/covering.  There is a streetlight outside this window, and so each night the bedroom was illuminated with the light through the window, through the shower.  In addition, there was a large crack under the door, through which light shone.-The \"breakfast\" is simply coffee in a thermos container, some juice, some dry cereal and danishes....nothing more.  We used to call this a \"continental breakfast\"...but, seems the hotel is being a bit misleading by calling it a breakfast, in which one would assume it would include eggs, sausage, biscuits, etc...-The staff was o.k.  No one was rude.  However, no one went out of their way to be helpful or outgoing either.The Bad:-The air conditioner cooled nicely, but it was LOUD and rattled.  The first night it vibrated so much that the glasses on the counter made noise and shook, (I removed the glasses the following night).  I could also hear the a/c come on in the room next to mine!-The Roman Shade on the window is broken.  One can raise it...but, it is haphazard and hangs crooked.All in all, it looks like the hotel has been updated a few years ago, the furnishings are newer in style....but, it is all a little \"rough\" now.   The hotel could use some TLC...replace window coverings, quiet the a/c, invest in new bedding, etc...If I return to this area of South Beach, I would consider this hotel again, if the price were right, and others nearby didn't seem any better at this price point.It is just o.k."

        "review_text": "Yes, the 4 Queens is an older hotel but oh the convenience to all of downtown is soooooo nice.No resort fees.  Internet is 8.99 per 24 hour period billed directly thru Cox as of this writing.I've stayed here over the years and have learned a few things:  1)  If the noise from the Fremont Steet Experience might bother you then ask for a room that is away from Fremont St; 2) as with most hotels, ask ahead of time for a non-smoking room on a non smoking floor; 3) the bell desk staff is extremely helpful..... do not be afraid to ask for their opinions or advice; 4). Join the players club ---- the discounts on food at the 4Q restaurants is worth it even if you don't gamble.If you have a problem with your room call housekeeping and/or maintenance.  They always respond timely (for me anyway).You walk out of the 4Q and The Fremont, TheD, The Golden Nugget and Binions are 20 yards away.  All of downtown is within walking distance so no car is needed.  Shared ride shuttles to/from the airport to downtown is less than 20$ round trip.  (Taxis are expensive!).I will definitely stay here again when visiting downtown Las Vegas.  Well worth the money and convenience."

        "review_text": "\"Guaranteed Rate\" is a scam. I asked hotel manager, Shelby Masacek, to honor their website promise - see photo - and she said that once you've checked in they will not do that (she couldn't show me any fine print...just refused to accommodate us in any way). She was impatient and not friendly.  I told people in line to check the website rate before they checked in and she threatened to have me thrown out if the hotel.If I'm honest, the hotel is fine (clean, etc). But I feel that when a customer points out a \"promise\" from your own website, you should find a friendly way to make them feel right. We stayed 3 nights and spent a lot of $ here...but we'll never come back."

        "review_text": "My wife and I had never atttended a time share promo and while booking another Holiday Inn location for a trip accepted a promotional offer to stay at this property free for 4days/3nights in exchange for attending a sales promotion.  We were quite pleased with the Desert Club Resort.  The room was nice. We had a 1 bedroom unit with a living room kitchen combined.  The living room included a gas log fireplace which was cheery in the cool evenings.  The front desk staff, and arrival attendants, and all of the shuttle drivers were friendly and professional. Our unit was on the back of the large complex but a shuttle bus was always promptly available for pick up or to take us to our room.  The only negative was the OVERLY ENTHUSIASTIC SALES PROMO. They were so insistent on closing a deal in that meeting and refusing to provide any research material for me to consider and research before deciding on a significant capital investment that they turned me off completely and lost any possibility of a sale to me.  They did refund my original payment of $249 in cash as promised after I attended the presentation.  I do not know if you can just book accomodations here without being required to attend a sales presentation or not.  If they do then I would not hesitate to stay here again. If attending a sales presentation is mandatory then I would not stay here again.  Be aware that it is about a 20-30 minute walk to the Las Vegas Strip.  The room was fine and all the staff except for sales was great."

The extra service charges, taxes, delivery charge and pre-assigned gratuity will skyrocket the cost.4. It's way cheaper to rent an Enterprise Car at the hotel then at the airport. However, they gave us two cars with zero  gas and it is \u201ca challenge\u201d to return the car to their garage after 8 o'clock at night.5.

Breakfast across the street at Wolfgang Puck Express is great!If you liked these tips, tell me...I have quite a few up my sleeve...PS The staff is great, however, hotel guests can be loud and disruptive.The doors are like paper.

        "review_text": "WOW! What a horrible stay.  From start to finish.  First, the hotel in a deliberate attempt t mislead guests does not warn them that there is a strike going on that creates significant noise from 7 am - 10 pm, endangers guests as they attempt to enter and leave the hotel, and closes several hotel services such as the restaurants, room service and housekeeping.  Security is also very weak.I have stayed at this hotel many times in the past and always liked it, but this time - the hotel should simply be ashamed.  No forewarning and they had the nerve to charge higher rates than standard.I am Platinum Elite - yet the hotel did not honor any of the benefits connected to that status.  Although suites were available, the hotel did not offer me one - these suites would have been on the quiet side of the hotel allowing for some sleep.When we entered the hotel, the protesters outside were very loud and yelling into megaphones.  They were saying things like no money no peach, no wage increase no sleep.  They yelled names at arriving guests and they stood right in front of the door (on the side) saying shame, shame and \"Do not let me see you again\".  It was all rather unnerving, especially since the hotel knowing that this had been going on for more than a month, never provided any advance warning.The hotel desk agent, simply ignored my status, told me there was no room service, no restaurant, breakfast would be $33 and buffet only.  No food after 10 pm.  and no housekeeping except during 8 am-2 pm.  The hotel said no late check-outs and the only entry and exit to the building was the front door, meaning you had to walk by the protesters to get in and out, instead of using the side door - where there we no rioters.The room was not cleaned to the usual standard.  Towels did not smell fresh. no ice was provided, hallways were not that clean, staff overall not very nice.I paid $380 before taxes for a room with no benefits, where I had to go outside to buy water and food.  I truyly felt like a prisoner in the hotel.At 7 am the noise started and it could not be ignored.  The hotel both failed to lower the rate or honor my elite benefits.Simply put this is outrageous.  No guest should show up at a hotel without warning.I will be expecting that the hotel provide a full and complete refund of the entire stay, pluys the $100 for its failure to offer the elite benefits.  I will also contact my credit card company to dispute the charge.Marriott has generally been an honest company, but there lack of candor with what was happening at there hotel really troubles me.I urge others to stay far away from this hotel during the strike and I urge you to think twice about going back even after the strike.  Once a hotel has lost your trust, it is time to seek other more honest options."

        "review_text": "For the unitiated, Dr.Who is an intergalactic time traveller who uses a Tardis time machine which looks like a police phone box but actually opens into a dramatically larger space.Come to the overpriced Halekulani if you want a Dr. Who experience,,.....the whole place is locked somewhere in the mid 1980's, the shower cubicles in the hotel rooms are, unlike the Tardis, actually smaller than they appear and you can bang various body parts as you attempt to shower, and in a further Dr.Who analogy, if you want to meet aliens from distant planets, just go onto your balcony and be hailed by fellow residents of this establishment. Go lie by the pool, and join the sardines in a can. Not the place to go in cognito or to attempt a weekend assignation. All too cheek by jowl. The House Without A Key is another 'pack 'em in' experience, so if you are after sophisticated cocktails as the sun sets, forget it.While the property can't do much in the short term or even long term regarding location or geographical orientation, it can plan to bring the property into the 21st century. It is soooo locked in the 80's.There is nothing much wrong with the staff (over attentive, over manned, over uniformed?) but the product of the Halekulani is confused.Do we want a blizzard of tent cards in our rooms? Do I really want a 'gift' of a conch shell? No, I'd like a plate to put the remnants of the fruit basket on! Do I want an invitation to tomorrow night's 'Manager's Cocktail' when I will have already left the country!? What?So what is the Halekulani product or more correctly the Halekulani target market? Over-wintering US widows, Japanese families, Australian shoppers? I don't know and the hotel certainly doesn't. I do know it isn't for me.In three cab rides to the hotel, on hearing 'Halekulani' , all three drivers responded, unprompted, ' ah, the most expensive hotel in Honolulu'. True. Worth it? definitely not.In defence of the hotel, they did respond to concerns by putting up the restaurant manager to hear our views, writing off the meal cost, following up with a phone call at 9.30 at night, but this doesn't resolve the basic issue that at over $700 a night, this is at best, a three star experience. Food quality was at best average and to serve bland stodgy bowls of rice with main courses again talks to the questions as to whom The Halekulai thinks it is catering.In The Orchids restaurant, when at 15 tables, some with up to 8 guests per table, no-one is actually eating and several have taken to their I-phones, the take-away impression has to be that is isn't the greatest culinary experience in the world.A final gripe, if you want to make a dinner reservation, just dial the appropriate button from your room. You can listen to 'Muzak' for 15 minutes and get nowhere. This doesn't matter as preferred outside dining tables are on a first come first served basis so don't bother booking! This is what you get at $700 a night.Before Christmas we stayed at The Modern hotel, down the road. We know where we'll stay when next in Hawaii.We leave tomorrow. Can't wait for Dr. Who to transport us out of here."

        "review_text": "My wife and I are big patrons of Marriott hotels because of the excellent service we always receive when we stay at their hotels. We even had our wedding reception in a Marriott hotel in our country early this year. However, we had a very bad experience when we stayed here at Marriott Union Square. We had a \"family and friends discount\" from a good friend who is a Marriott employee so during check-in we were told that we can send them the discount form thru email or fax. Then out of nowhere a front desk staff named JEFF (who was not even the one attending to us) started screaming and pointing at me and my PREGNANT wife that we should give them the original form and was screaming at us asking where the original form is. Before he meddled, he was attending to two caucasian guests and he was very friendly and accommodating, even joking around and laughing with them. But when he started talking to us (we are Asians) he raised his voice, humiliating me and my wife in front of the front desk staff and other guests,  telling us very rudely to get away from the front desk and wait until he calls us again. We felt so discriminated. Why did he need to humiliate us in front of the whole lobby for a piece of paper, when he could have just told us in a nice way what he wants. When he called us again, I just told him to just charge us for the full amount of the room so we can get out of there. We were on a hurry so i talked to his supervisor after getting back to the hotel a few a hours later. He apologized to us and gave me and my PREGNANT wife a bottle of wine for the inconvenience. Thank you very much Marriott Union Square for your racist and insensitive service. Next time you check in this hotel, be sure to be white and look rich."

        "review_text": "I'm extremely critical in all my reviews as tripadvisor has served me abounds for 12 years so it's time to pay it forward. I\u2019m assigning this hotel a rating of 2.75 and request that instead of worrying about replying to guest commentary on TA management focuses on addressing the in house issues I describe below so that future guests can have a better experience.  I was in Florida for about 2 weeks during the holidays so needless to say things weren\u2019t exactly cheap, this hotel was for a couple of nights, to be my last before a long drive back north so I made sure I booked something I knew I would be comfortable in since some of my other hotels on the trip would prove to be less then stellar. At just shy of $450usd a night my expectations were high, as you may know from some of my other reviews I adjust expectations based on price & country to give everyone a fair shot so to speak.Pros: Helpful front desk staff who took our luggage, allowed us to park out front & unload & showed us all the functionality of the room. Nice view from the rooftop terrace, bed was comfy, extra pillow was a good idea, great location to all the action, beach is steps away across the street.Cons: This hotel unfortunately hit me with all 3 of my pet peeves; Maid noise, internet, & additional expenses. First off I\u2019m confused with the term \u201ckitchenette\u201d I had 3 on this trip to florida ONE had a stove it was not Edgewater. I\u2019m not blaming the hotel but what does the term mean, is a stove required to be called a kitchenette or not, because you can\u2019t cook without a stove am I right? Secondly, the attached picture is of my flooded shower floor with 1.5\u201d of water undrained after use. We mentioned the issue of poor draining after the first shower on our way out for the day and returned 6 hours later, it was never fixed. Third, the infamous \u201cknock, knock, knock\u201d. I was awaken at 8:30am the first morning to hear the maids in the room above us moving all the furniture to vacuum (couldn\u2019t really hear the vacuum itself but all the furniture being moved, and it sounded like 3 knocks, then again a few minutes later another 3, then EVERY few minutes after that till 10am. It progressively got louder, what was the noise you ask? The maids must prop the room doors open when cleaning and go in and out, every time they do you get the \u201cknock, knock, knock\u201d. I\u2019m not going to complain to someone just trying to do their job it\u2019s not their fault. Management, you\u2019re reading this right? Go check it out for yourself you will hear it. So when they started cleaning my floor as they got closer to my room the louder it got. Fourth the internet was fast but kept going in and out. I had to wander around my room to get the signal then it would work great for 15 min then cut out again. Really annoying and I\u2019m dependent on internet access for work. I asked for a late checkout, they said the first hour would be free and $75 for 2 hours after that, no thanks, not sure why it\u2019s a big deal they start cleaning the rooms at 8:30am.  Finally, the $18 resort fee (rebuttal to management; wifi is basically available everywhere nowadays for FREE, no one reads newspapers & we can make all the local calls we want on our cell phones). When I think \"resort\" I think either pool or parking availability or both; or am I wrong? This hotel offers neither of those things for my fee. I did the math 45 rooms in the hotel maybe average 70% occupancy at $20 a room yeah that about pays for your daily employee, $10 bottles of wine at sunset, Sunny D (which is not actual orange juice btw) & plastic bag croissants. I used the breakfast 1 morning since I was awaken by the maid noise but after realizing it wasn\u2019t really breakfast at all & wasn\u2019t worth waking up for I skipped it. I don\u2019t feel customers should be forced to pay a \u201cresort fee\u201d that money can be used by your customers for real food (in the immediate vicinity as you say) or parking we have to pay for.In summary I wouldn\u2019t run back. At about $275usd a night you would hear nothing but praise from me, but not at nearly double that rate. I understand it was the holiday season, I hadn\u2019t been to Miami in at least 5 years, the traffic has gotten much worse, the parking intolerable now they have 24hr meters & residential permits, and the price gouging is rampant & absurd. Instead of banging your customers with a \u201cresort fee\u201d why not buck the clich\u00e9 miami trend of trying to empty the customers pocket & build it into your daily rate so they think they are getting more for less? If there is any advice I can offer it is expand your horizons there is so much more to this world than Miami Beach especially for what you are shelling out to be there. Edgewater is one of the top hotels on TA, if they can\u2019t get it right, I\u2019m not sure there is much hope for the rest of South Beach."

        "review_text": "To preface this review, I will say this\u2014my boyfriend has worked in hotels for 30 years and I have worked in customer service roles (food + beverage industry) for over 10 years. We really value good customer service and supporting smaller, local hotels. We know it\u2019s  a hard job so we try to be as understanding as possible. This review covers our five days/four nights at the New Otani. We were there from Saturday 12/30/17 until Thursday 01/04/18.Bellman:My boyfriend and I spent the month at Sans Souci next door and wanted to check into this hotel for the last leg of our trip. Since we are planning to spend future winters in Hawaii, we especially wanted to make sure this hotel would be a good one to recommend to friends while they visit us. It shares a parking lot with Sans Souci so it seemed like the perfect choice.We called New Otani to see if a bellman could help us move our luggage from our condo to the hotel. They were used to this request and Chris (our bellman) came up to our condo, loaded our luggage, and took it to our hotel room. Chris is amazing! He is so friendly and really made us laugh. He made a great impression and definitely set the hotel up for success, in terms of our experience.Check in:We walked over to check into the hotel, only to immediately encounter a rude interaction with the front desk receptionist, Aki. Perhaps it was the language barrier, but she was very condescending. She also paused in the middle of checking us in in order to enthusiastically help another guest. We took note of her name and decided to just go to our room to unwind.Americano run:Once we got to our room, my boyfriend started getting a caffeine headache. He requested I get him an Americano from the bar while he gets some work done. No problem, so I went downstairs to the hotel bar + restaurant to get him an Americano. The espresso machine was behind the bar so, naturally, I went to the bar. What I did not expect was the bartender to look at me like I was barged into her room as soon as I stepped foot into the restaurant. The look was seriously a cross of \u201cwhat TF do you want\u201d and \u201cyou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d There were 3 people at the bar\u20142 European women, 1 European man. Yet she made me feel like a pariah. I later learned her name is Lori. Nevertheless, I politely asked her for an Americano. I had my hand on the bar chair to pull it out and sit down while I waited for my beverage. Before I could move it, she aggressively told me that I could take a seat at the table and a waiter would help me. She then rolled her eyes and began to ask the woman seated closest to me if she needed anything. Ooookay. The waiter witnessed all of this yet he didn\u2019t say or do anything. I go to a table a couple of feet away from the bar and look up at the waiter. We make eye contact and he looks away to look at the bartender. They share a look and a few words. He looks back at me and again looks away. After a minute (it felt much longer) he finally comes over. He hands me a menu and asks what I would like. I order the Americano and the check. At this point, I felt so hurt and humiliated. I was treated like rift raft meanwhile witnessing other patrons receiving good service. I asked myself if it was my clothes\u2014shorts & a tank top\u2014but it\u2019s a beach front hotel in Hawaii, everyone is dressed similarly. The only thing that separated me from the people at the bar is the color of my skin. The waiter came back with the Americano and the bill. I asked him if I could take it up to my room, signed off on the bill, and left. For the first time in my life, I did not tip.Aftermath:I went up to my hotel room and felt like crying. I\u2019m not a sensitive woman, but I haven\u2019t had an interaction like that in a long time. Especially not in a establishment that we were spending quite a bit of money on during peak season. My boyfriend could tell I was upset and after a few moments, I told him what happened. He immediately recognized her behavior as wildly inappropriate. He went downstairs to talk to a manager. He was met with what could only be described as incompetence. No managers available and a promise to pass along his message for a chat with the dining manager, Ted. That would have to do for now. He came back upstairs, I took a shower, and we went on with our day.Bedtime:We were determined to try to make the best of the day (and the rest of our stay). The lanai in our ocean view room was beautiful. We loved looking at the water while chatting and enjoying each other\u2019s company. As we were getting ready for bed, I playfully fell backwards onto the bed with a huge yawn. As soon as I opened my eyes, I saw more than 100+ bugs flying along the ceiling. Shocked, I began to look around and noticed they were all along the walls, in my cup of water, in the bed sheets, and pillows. Horrified, I jumped out of bed and got my boyfriend\u2019s attention. I pointed out the bugs and began to feel itchy. He called the front desk. Apparently they were having a gnat infestation and did not bother to tell us upon check in. Not once did they apologize. Instead they tried to make it seem like it was our fault for using the lanai. Luckily, they sent over housekeeping and they vacuumed up a good chunk of the gnats. Falling asleep after that was very difficult and I shudder to think what else we would have found if we had a black light.Ted:My boyfriend and I continued our stay, although every hotel was booked so we didn\u2019t have much of a choice. Upon returning from lunch, my boyfriend went up to the desk and asked to speak to Ted. Ted was within earshot to he turned and said, \u201cyeah, I\u2019m Ted.\u201d We introduced ourselves and asked if he received our message from the day before. He did not. I\u2019m not quite sure how to describe Ted, but he is a much older man. During the conversation he had a blank look on his face. Quite frankly, he doesn\u2019t know what is going on and doesn\u2019t seem all there. His speech was very slow and he seemed confused. It appears that his employees take advantage of that. He left to speak to Lori. He came back and stated that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t recall\u201d that interaction and that there was a misunderstanding. My boyfriend tells him that\u2019s not an acceptable answer, especially because the situation was pretty straight forward. Again, Ted says it was a misunderstanding. My boyfriend repeats that he will not accept that as a valid excuse then asks for the general managers name. Finally Ted apologizes \u201con behalf of Lori.\u201d We asked for the general managers name again. Ted tells us his name is \u201cMr. Celebrate.\u201d Huh? Ted tells us he\u2019ll be back on Tuesday. My boyfriend tells Ted our room number and asks him to set up a meeting with the four of us. We go back to our room and I tell my boyfriend that I\u2019m pretty sure the GM\u2019s name is Jean-Pierre. I read it somewhere but wasn\u2019t completely sure. We look up his name & it\u2019s Jean-Pierre Cercillieux. Either Ted didn\u2019t know his manager\u2019s name or he gave us a fake name. I\u2019m leaning towards he didn\u2019t know his name or how to pronounce it. I hate to say it but incompetence has become a trend here with the staff. The exceptions being the bellmen, valets, and the housekeeping staff. They were and continued to be amazing and kind\u2014were the highlight of our stay.Ted failed to set up a meeting with Jean-Pierre and I suspect he never even tried to set up a meeting. He and my boyfriend played phone tag with Ted. Ted left us a message Tuesday afternoon while we were out, my boyfriend returned the message the following morning. Ted was not there when we checked out on Thursday.Gnats Attack:Our room got progressively worse with the gnats. We no longer left water cups by our bed, and had a nightly \u201critual\u201d of having someone come up to vacuum as many gnats as they could with a handheld vacuum. We often laughed and joked with them as they vacuumed the gnats. We thanked them profusely every night and tipped them for their time (as we should). By Wednesday, the gnats became out of control. I attached photos of them in a corner above the bed. That night Jonathan was helping up and he stopped vacuuming a quarter of the way through. He said there were way too many gnats and suggested we ask the front desk to move us. He saw the gnats all over the bed and in the sheets. He was so sweet and was very concerned. I called the front desk and told the male on the phone that Jonathan suggested we changed rooms. He responded with \u201coh okay. I\u2019ll take a look at the rooms available.\u201d I should mention that we had to call them every night so the gnats would get vacuumed and not once did we receive an apology from the front desk. The only ones that showed pride in the hotel & genuinely felt bad were the men that came up to vacuum the gnats. Thank you, gentlemen, we appreciate you. Oh and shout out to Gemma for being our housekeeper and doing a fantastic job with our room everyday. My mom is a custodian, it\u2019s not an easy job. We appreciate you!New room:Jonathan took care of the entire room change and came back up to our room with keycards. We couldn\u2019t help but think that THAT is how a manager should respond. He saved the evening. He showed my boyfriend the room while I packed my suitcases back up. Jonathan got us an ocean view suite with an 180\u00b0 view of the ocean. Honestly, I wish we could have enjoyed it more but this was the worst hotel experience of our life. During the walk down to see the new room, Jonathan asked my boyfriend about our stay. He is the first person in the hotel that asked either one of us that question. My boyfriend was honest with him about our experience. Jonathan felt really bad and we could tell he really wanted to redeem it for us. Unfortunately it was our last night and a little too late. Huge thank you to Jonathan for trying to salvage the trip for us.The view was beautiful. We speculated about what our experience would have been like if we spent every night in this suite instead. Honestly, the room was spacious and the view was spectacular. However the sink was somehow cracked and resealed, the paint was chipping, and there were weird, dirty smudge marks all over the walls. Also the bathroom was painted blue while the room was green. For a hotel that was recently remodeled, it seemed a little run down with seemingly new furniture.There were still gnats in the suite due to the infestation but it wasn\u2019t as bad as our previous room. We went to sleep knowing this nightmare was almost over.Checking out:Chris helped us with our luggage again. He brightened up our morning with his positivity.  Both he and Jonathan should be promoted\u2014they are the only ones that actually care about the hotel and the guests. Checking out was relatively painless. Not a single apology was offered over the hostility we encountered nor the gnat infestation. I looked over the bill while my boyfriend called the Lyft. Chris and the valet loaded our luggage into the Lyft and cheerfully sent us on our way, wishing us safe travels. We let out a huge sigh of relief as our Lyft driver drove us away. We survived.P.S. Avoid the restaurant. The servers are nice but aren\u2019t well trained. They don\u2019t know anything about their wine list. The bottle red we got was barely drinkable (even with a decanter).The mushrooms in the mushroom soup were undercooked; I only took two bites, my boyfriend was starving so he took it down. We had to go to another restaurant nearby after we paid for the meal because we were still hungry & didn\u2019t trust anything on the menu.New Otani, unfortunately Sans Souci shares a parking lot with you so we\u2019ll be seeing you again next year. However, in the future, we will not make the mistake of dining or staying with you."

        "review_text": "I came to Washington and they chose this hotel since it was the number one hotel on trip advisor and I was bringing my girlfriend for a special trip. I chose a large suite, so we are talking about $1000/day.  They tell you there's a car available to take you to dinner but you can't reserve the car it's first come first serve and it's never available. There were many other small items that you don't expect in a hotel that projects itself as being number one in quality in Washington DC but the worst the problem.is  that the first night we went to dinner came back expected a room that was clean and had been turned down for the evening and found that there was no service at all the excuses were sorry we forgot . The next day because my girlfriend had recently had knee surgery and could only walk for about two hours I specifically stopped housekeeping told them when we were leaving and when we would be back. We returned at the appropriate time the room had never been made up the excuse was that the person in housekeeping that I spoke to did not understand English . This was a major problem because of her recent surgery after walking around the city we were required to ice her knee down with no room available we had to wait an hour and then wait another half an hour for room service to bring ice. I could go on but I think I have made my point there are many lovely hotels in the city I suggest that you choose a different one than the Jefferson save some money and save yourself a lot of aggravation"

        "review_text": "First of all, I'd like to make it clear that the one star rating is only for the facility itself. The staff was very friendly and professional.Aside from the friendly staff, this hotel has a great location and the complimentary wifi is a welcome feature as well.However, here is what's wrong with this facility - during my first night stay here, I spotted a bed bug in the middle of the night in the pillow beside my head! Having never seen a bed bug before, I was not sure but confirmed my suspicion by googling images of bed bugs. You can find the picture I took of the bed bug I found on the pillow in the photo section. Googling also taught me that one of the signs of bed bug infestation was a musty smell. And that matched as well since a weird smell was present every time I came back to the room from outside. Anyhow, I called the front desk and they immediately offered to move me to a different room. This second room did not have weird smell. However there was no way for me to know whether this room was clean. Not seeing a bed bug does not mean it does not exist. This room faces the street and is on second floor. The sound insulation was so poor that I felt I were literally sleeping on the street. Non stop traffic noise!!The staff assured me upon my checking out that they had taken action to deal with the problem. Until that problem is resolved, I would not recommend this hotel. In addition, I don't think they can do anything about the noise problem short of installing sound proof window etc.."

        "review_text": "We made a reservation for 3 nights at this hotel at the last minute.  Got a great deal, and such a nice surprise when we walked through the doors of this cute, hip and friendly boutique hotel.Sean,  who manned the front desk, is one of the best examples of exemplary customer service that I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  From the first point of contact, he was professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  It's refreshing to find someone so good at their job that it makes the guests happy to spend a few nights at the Zetta.The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  Beds luxurious, comfortable and hard-to-leave.  The location is perfect.  Only steps away from public transportation, the Westfield shopping center, the cable car stop, and more.When we are next in San Franicsco, we will be staying at this awesome hotel."

        "review_text": "I booked a family premier room (triple) at the main tower. Upon check in, after checking their system, I was told that only the north wing is available. I clearly booked it on  the main tower as the north wing is very far away. I was told to top up THB3000 in total for my upgrade to suite in the main tower. As I was with my friends and didn't want to argue any further, I made my displeasure known that this is absolutely rubbish. I am sure Agoda can verify and check.  FYI, North wing is a huge distance away from the main tower and you have to walk a long distance.During my stay, one of the nights, I was shocked 2 men trying to enter our room with the card key with a suspicious bag right outside my door. Then after awhile, they attempted to try the room next to ours. I quickly called the operator and after four calls, finally 45min later, 2 security ladies appeared at my door. Hello? What kind of security you have in this 5 star hotel?I will not be back for sure."

        "review_text": "We stayed at the Hyatt Place during the 5 days we were in Honolulu. The location is pretty awesome. You\u2019re steps away from Waikiki beach, a ton of restaurants and shopping. They also offer free beach towels, so be sure to ask for one before you head over to the beach.Room: we got upgrade to a mountain view room, but the view was less than impressive. We saw a sliver of mountain between two high-rises in the distance. Both of us slept comfortably, which was good enough for us.Breakfast: we tried their free breakfast and it wasn\u2019t very good. It was chaotic with all the kids running around and screaming early in the morning. The scrambled eggs were soggy and runny.. overall, a poor experience.Parking: they charge $39 for valet, which was the only parking option we had even though we read that there was self parking available (not true). This fee will give you in and out privileges; you\u2019ll just need to ring them up 10 minutes in advance so they can fetch your car. There is also a parking lot diagonal to the hotel, which charges $30 for 24 hour parking. The cheapest option is parking at the zoo parking lot nearby, which is $1.50 per hour and you can park there overnight with no problems. Since we were renting a car and driving out every day early in the morning, we only had to park at the zoo at most 12 hours, so that costed us only $18, yay! If you don\u2019t mind walking for 4-5 minutes to the hotel, this is the most economical IMO. Just keep in mind that there are a ton of tourists in this area and Waikiki Beach, so going there to park at peak times can result in an overcrowded lot and you may not find a spot.Destination fees (via Expedia): this was very annoying. I had another look at my Expedia receipt and low and behold there was a destination fee charge there (which I may have known when I booked it but was outraged when I was reminded upon arrival). How can you avoid this charge? You can\u2019t, if you\u2019re booking through a third party like Expedia unfortunately. We booked one night directly, because I had enough points to get us a free night and with that booking there was no destination fee. Perhaps, they are doing this to recoup some of the cost that OTAs are charging hotels, but it also seems unfair that the customer (us travelers) are suffering as a result. If you get charged, make the most out of it and make sure you use your $10 allowance each day to buy a bottle of water or two otherwise it\u2019s going to waste."

        "review_text": "What was my favourite hotel has now become a glorified Butlins!The refurb is dreadful, looks cheap and tacky and staff are rude and useless.I have stayed at JBH many times and could not fault this hotel and would recommend to all my friends however stayed there last week and cannot find one positive thing to say.To name a few things -After a 14 hour flight with children we arrived at the hotel and we were not greeted by anyone - went to the front desk and told our room was not ready! We had booked a club suite and yet left standing in a cold reception area with no seating. 3pm came and went and still no room and no one bothered to come and see us - we kept chasing them.They then found a room which was smaller than a travel lodge and the bathroom could not even fit a full bath. The worst was yet to come - my 8 year old opened a wardrobe to find electrical high voltage boxes and pipes with warnings on! The door handles came off in your hands and there were holes that needed filling, the level of craftmanship on the room was sub standard.The new Kitchen restaurant is unbelievable - in a very bad way. Its like an office canteen with bright lights and cheap tables. The food choice is non existant and poor quality with most sections empty and no food! Choice of pizza and pasta as their main options! The displays were filthy were people had dropped food and no one had cleared them up.We chose to sit outside and they showed us to an area at the end of the restaurant as all the tables were used and had not been cleaned! When we sat there we realised we had been put in a smoking area where guests came to smoke during their meal. I have 2 kids and was fuming. I complained and they moved us to a dirty table with food and drink all over the floor. Again I complained and asked for someone to clear it up - the waiter just smirked at me!The new staff are untrained and rude and could not care less.The executive pool is another disaster with not enough beds and reserved beds that no one uses.No buggies in sight - with people arguing over them when a random one appears.I could go on all night.JBH I will never return and am very sad that you have mananged to destroy a wonderful hotel that had a wonderful reputation."

        "review_text": "It was important for us to not be in a chain. We like family run establishments and this family knows its hospitality. We were thoroughly impressed. From the front desk welcoming and efficiency to the decor and size of our room. We loved it all. We requested a quite room, and got one. The bed, linens and towels were lovely. Everything was fantastic. We were there to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and the staff made us feel so special. Importantly, the Handlery was centrally located so we could walk everywhere and we did so and felt safe. We have already told everyone about this SF gem. We left our hearts in SF at the Handlery."

        "review_text": "We attended a time share presentation at Tahiti Village. First, they make you wait 30 minutes after the time of your appoitment. Then they talked to you about an hour or 2 telling them their lifestory (usually something sad) and ask you tons of personal questions to connect with you. We did not want to be rude, so we went along. Finally , after an hour or 2 , they start explaining what is time share and how they are different that the other timeshare. 45 minutes later, we said no, then , they sent another guy, the price got cut by 50%, looked interesting but we passed. After that, and more than the 2 hour commitment we agreed on, they asked if we could talk to another person who just wanted to ask us a few questions to make sure we had a pleasant visit. Now, we get another offer $2000 for 30000 points for 2 years . Still didn't want to do it, more talking (at that point we had been there for over 3 hours), but they start telling us we could use 3 weeks of vacation including a week at Lake Tahoe for 8 people in August. Since we were planning on going and it would have cost us about $2000, we decided to do only after asking for confirmation that we would be able to get what we wanted. After we left (4.5 hours later), I started looking for reviews and quickly realised what they told us was not true. I called the next day to cancel, and they basically told us that we would not get ur money back. No, we will not get our week at Lake Tahoe because there is nothing available and it costs 22000 points for 1 bedroom!!! And it takes 45 days to access your account, so by the time you can use it, and realize it is a big scam, you don't really have any options. We are both educated with masters degree and I can't believe we fell for it! Please don't go to those presentations or tell them right away you just want your gift and your free nights and that you will leave after the 2 hours. Their sales tactics are deplorable. I tried to file a complaint with BBB but they said they are not the ones to contact. RCI told me the same thing too."

        "review_text": "I chose to stay at this hotel due to its press coverage and praise by foreign leaders. What I did not expect was to be itchy late in the night and see a few red marks. I'm not trying to draw conclusions but this has only happened twice before in all the traveling I've done, which forces me to travel extremely light and \"sleep light\". The look and feel of the hotel is nice, but I do find the Mandarin Oriental and even the Westin to be more hip and contemporary. The staff is still trying to figure it out, but I understand and am patient given he circumstances. However, I cannot get over the bed issue...hope this is an isolated case and no one else has to deal with this nuisance. Given the global travel that's occurring, anything spreads like a fire."

        "review_text": "We stayed 5 nights in a standard room in the original hotel building.  The room was a comfortable size, nicely remodelled and fully equipped.  The best part was the excellent king size bed and the top quality bed linens.  On the other hand, the soundproofing was not great.  Our room was connected to another, and on the one night that a family with two screaming children stayed in that room, we were treated to every sound each of them emitted.  Had they stayed longer, we would have had to relocate.The Royal Hawaiian has an old world charm that no other Waikiki hotel can match.  It truly is a respite in the midst of very busy hotels on either side and shopping behind.  The advantage is that we could choose which level of noise and activity we were in the mood for.  One of the disadvantages is that the pool is FAR too small for the current hotel, since the tower was added.  As a result, it was full of preschoolers, their parents and their air-filled floating paraphernalia.  The other aspect of the hotel we found lacking was the restaurant options.  The settings are lovely, but the menu offerings are very limited and portion sizes are much smaller than expected.  Given that, we would not hesitate to stay here again as the location is excellent and the hotel is charming."

You can easily see Palm Island & Burj Al Arab from the beach which makes for some stunning picture backdrops. Tagwa Adam & Amro Nagah (Mgt team) professional with high customer service standard, keen to make stay a luxury experience. Excellent air conditioning in Apartment, which is definitely needed during August, plus well equipped Kitchen. Views from balcony are amazing, see uploaded picture. Highly recommended, we really enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to book here again."

We did not know what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised! What a good find! A quaint little boutique hotel in the heart of the city! Central location to everything, two blocks up from union square and two blocks away from Top of the Mark for cocktails & a gorgeous view of San Francisco! Plenty of restaurants nearby, Comfortable beds with soft linen, fluffy white towels and courteous staff. Just what you need after a full day of sight seeing!"

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Elysian, the name of the property before it became the Waldorf, on opening night in 2008. I stayed for NYE 2008/9, my wife had her bachelorette party here, we stayed together numerous times, and we were members at the gym/spa when we were residents in the City before we moved to Michigan in 2014.....during these stays, the Elysian, and even at the beginning of the hotel conversion to Waldorf the hotel could have been considered one of the finest hotels in the world. We routinely stay at hotels like the George V, Claridge's, FS NY, and the Elysian/Waldorf Chicago was up there with them if note better.Today, I came back to the hotel and I am disgusted to find a hotel I loved so much fall to a level that its managed by incompetent and callous people who have low standards. Even worse, the details that were so beautiful in years past and to the previous staff have fallen into disrepair and the new staff could care less. The beautiful sculptures in the lobby? Sold and replaced by second rate flowers. The beautiful lobby lounge (which btw was the only place in the hotel to sit and do work quietly)? Replaced as a breakfast nook with folks sitting loudly all day....at one point a bright blue Coleman cooler was sitting in it too. Classy. The gorgeous Asprey products that were in the bathrooms? Replaced by second rate Ferragamo products you can get at TJ Maxx. The amazing Bowers & Wilkins sound machines in every room? Replaced by $50 ihome clock radios from Bed Bath & Beyond. The Frette towels? The  desk manager admitted they changed them out for cheaper ones. The beds? OMFG, see the picture attached for the gigantic stain found on my bed. Oh, and as far as stains go, they're everywhere....on the floor in the entry way of my room, on the backsplash in the mens spa. Btw, beware of the rusty screws where the bottles used to be in the showers in the spa, new management is too cheap and lazy to properly replace them so they just left them to rust. And if youre looking for dinner, Balsan is now closed (along with Ria which has been closed for years sadly) except for breakfast. And breakfast is a mess Balsan should be closed all day because the paint is chipping on the walls, the bar is poorly maintained, and its a place that looks like its closing entirely ---- which it is, as the hotel converts the restaurant entirely downstairs to the lobby \"which has been really well recieved so far\" so says the desk manager. Insane. Bernard's Bar, which was where one friendly manager kindly put me to work while my room was being readied (there is no quiet place to work in the hotel now that the lobby lounge is converted into a chintzy half - assed breakfast area) is a mess too. It used to be one of the coolest hotel bars in the city if not the country. Now? The down pillows have feathers spewing out of them, the chairs and ottomans have the bottoms falling out of them and the place has totally lost its charm. Not to worry, its going away anyways when it becomes part of the two story restaurant going in the lobby.Its pathetic that this has happened to such a beautiful hotel. Whats worse is that it happened to me on a weekend that I had flown my attorney up to discuss a potential merger and the issues completely and totally embarrassed me. I can tell you this....the hotel is a mess, they are focused on changes, they arent a five star any longer, and you are MUCH BETTER OFF SPENDING YOUR MONEY AT THE LANGHAM, PENINSULA, OR FOUR SEASONS. Be warned....and if you dont believe me check the pictures."

Very nicely done, clean, comfortable bed (and I'm fussy about that), coffee maker, concierge service.   They have a small pool - not sure I would want a room facing the pool unless street noise is really bothersome to you.  I didn't think street view was a problem. San Francisco is an expensive city so the price here made it a  great choice."

        "review_text": "The hotel in general is pretty standard and came at a decent price for the location only.Pros- close to Waikiki downtown- close to popular sites & hikes- has stores inside for quick merchandise pick-upCons- they didn\u2019t tell you there is a resort fee until you get there ($30 more EACH day)- parking is $40 if you park yourself and $45 if you valet... not really a good price at all- Ocean-view room is extremely loud from all the traffic on the street- staff aren\u2019t all that friendly at all except for valet.Personal experienceI called a month before we arrived to make sure chocolate covered strawberries and drinks were in the hotel before we got there (celebrating 2 year anniversary) and asked how much parking was a day - guy on the phone said \u201c$10\u201d so I thought sweet! I\u2019ll rent a car.Got to the hotel, found out what \u201creal\u201d parking cost. The guy at the front desk who checked us in was super rude, and when I asked him if he could talk to the guy who set up our reservation he was very reluctant and tried to hurry us off by telling us the resort fee and throwing us our keys. Food for thought - tell your guests there is a fee, I probably wouldn\u2019t have booked this hotel knowing that since we used zero of the amenities. Also, I wouldn\u2019t have rented a car knowing the price of parking.Resort fee includes : free WiFi, pool, dvds, gym, and a few other unworthy things. There\u2019s a beach across the street, I didn\u2019t need WiFi because I\u2019m on vacation and if I wanted it I would pay it myself, we are hardly in the hotel so I didn\u2019t used the dvds and I\u2019m not working out during vacation. All in all - Things they should tell you while you book.Got to my room, nothing I ordered was there. Had to call and asked them not to charge my card.We ordered room service (a salad and a burger) $70! Seventy frikkin dollars! Not only do they charge 20% grat, they also charge you a service fee on top of the tip. Then why am I tipping you if I\u2019m already paying you to take the elevator? The food was subpar - not worth it. Won\u2019t do that againAll in all, would I stay here again? No.  I am paying an extra $70 a day on top of the $150 I paid per night to be here. Best bet is to Airbnb or pay $220 to stay at a nicer place. The location is nice, the hotel is big, but it\u2019s really nothing spectacular. My biggest irritation is that they withhold information to get you to pay more when you arrive. What am I gonna say, \u201cno, I\u2019m not going to pay for parking or for your resort fee\u201d? Never stayed at a Marriott before, probably won\u2019t ever again."

        "review_text": "We have stayed here many, many times over the years. But, this was our first stay as locals. We checked in for 3 nights in late April 2017.Driving up to the entrance is still as fabulous as ever. They still adorn you with leis...flower lei for ladies and kukui nut for men. But, sadly, the kukui nut lei was plastic from China. $40.00 a night to park your vehicle. Ridiculously high.We arrived early and were given our room before noon, which was nice. No complimentary morning tea and coffee in the lobby, as in the past. Only one small piece of luggage but an attendant needed to take it to the room for us...for a tip. Our room was in the historic wing. The hallways have no a/c so quite warm.Room was nice size with high ceilings. Room was dark. The furniture is the furniture from their re-do about 10 years ago. It was Quite beat up, especially the nightstands. It should not look as it does for guests. Nice size closet with safe. A/C worked fine and kept the room cool. Bathroom was tight but functional and had a window in it...from the old days. How nice...you don't see that anymore. Gone is the PINK almost everywhere before...no Royal Hawaiian towels, toiletries, logo slippers, pens, privacy door sign, coasters, stir sticks, etc. I called housekeeping for slippers in our room. They brought by plain white ones with NO logo. Sigh :(   Daily resort fee that gives you 2 bottles of water.  Another sigh :(All the years we have stayed before, there was always a welcome banana cake, papaya, lime, etc. on the bed for guests. No more. You get ONE card, regardless of how many nights you stay, for pastries at the RH Bakery on the main floor. You get a small paper bag there and can fill it up with a choice from the \"lesser\" pastries available. Still nice...just not the same.Pool is round and smaller(not possible now to actually swim in it like before) and there is also a hot tub...even though it's hot most of the year. If you want seats at the pool, best be down when it opens in the morning. Beach lounges(2 & umbrella) are $40.00 plus tax PER day for guests and you can reserve in advance. Quite close together and they are placed near the rest. area so they are quite a good distance from the water. Other chairs w/umbrellas are also available at the waters edge. Again, $40.00 PER day for hotel guests. Others can rent for $50.00. No advance reservations taken...first come basis. If you want to be by the water...get these. In between these RH chairs and the other RH chairs by the rest., are MANY people laying on the beach...which is the nicest slice of Waikiki Beach anywhere. Fabulous location with a spectacular view of Diamond Head. POSTCARD PRETTY. The Beach Boys were helpful and polite. Service at the pool area was Spectacular and genuine. The young gentlemen working that area(for drinks, water, food) was a real asset to the RH.Breakfast is buffet and about $40.00 an adult, per day. Too high for us, it's just not worth it, in our opinion. We had a dinner reservation at Azure. But, after seeing the beat up furniture, we canceled it and went to Chuck's for the best steak we have had in a long time.Now, comes the Mai Tai Bar. On my, where do I start...We LOVE this place...or used to. Same great location. All the umbrellas overhead were moldy and many were ripped with actual holes in them. The wood furniture was all beat up. The bar stools are a disgrace. Cushions had bird droppings on them...not one cushion or two cushions, but all the cushions. A lone plant on each table...no more pink candle holders. Floor was sandy and had food on it, left from diners. ALL the table tops need a GOOD cleaning...not just a wipe down with some old dirty, rag they leave on the counter. The bar itself smelled like old rotten fruit(from the trash, I assume) . We tried to sit there but moved to a table to get away from the smell. Service was good and the food was also tasty. I will tell you, it was disappointing for us. They are making good money from the Mai Tai Bar and it should NOT look as it does. A big \"F\" in my book of ratings.In years past, the RH had a weekly manager's party for it's guests with cocktails and a few nibbles. No more. Not it's party is hit and miss...whenever. Sadly, not held the week we were guests :(The gift shops have nice quality items and are quite pricey. We took their twice weekly tour and it was excellent. I recommend you to do the same, if you can. They used to give out a small memento afterwards(pretty RH card, etc.)...you guessed it...not anymore.When we checked out and our vehicle was brought to us, the attendant was talking to us. He was unprofessional and talking about some woman's behavior with an overindulgence in alcohol. Really? Not anyone should be making comments like that. Our car had been parked under vegetation before they moved it to the parking garage. There was pollen and dirt, bird droppings, leaves, etc. on it...all over it. This is for $40.00 PER day parking fee. We had just taken it to the dealer for a detail. I did call the hotel and they did credit our bill. Your vehicle should be returned to you just as it arrived.All in all, we had a nice time. Many things have changed and not for the better, in our eyes and opinion.The hotel NOW goes by The Royal Hawaiian RESORT...instead of The Royal Hawaiian HOTEL. If anyone from management from the hotel is reading this...Do not compromise \"who you are\" by trying to be trendy. Be proud of your history, your NAME, give the little extras...and they will come.Like my title of this review reads...Still a Star In Waikiki But She Doesn't Shine as Bright as She Used To.Please give me Heads Up vote if this review has been helpful to you or yours. Aloha."

        "review_text": "When was the last time you were wrongly accused for something that you have absolutely sure that you have not done?  Well...this is my story with this hotel that I thought I should let everyone knows to avoid similar incident with this hotel.I checked in at this hotel at the Autograph Lounge on Dec 23rd evening to spend a Christmas holiday in Vegas.  Everything went great and I was quite happy, as I was given an upgrade to a Studio with Balcony on the 35th floor as a SPG/Marriott Platinum Elite member.On the 2nd morning (on the joyous Christmas Day), I received a notification from my Bank that my credit card has been charged an additional USD 500 by the hotel, IN ADDITION TO the USD 1000 when I checked in.So right before lunch time, I came down to the Autograph Lounge to clarify what the USD500 additional deposit is all about.  A lady at the desk looked up my room record, and said that \"Sir, we would charge additional deposit as more incidentals occur during your stay\".  I was so perplexed and asked what was the incidental I incurred, as I was absolutely sure that I did not order any room service, sign anything to the room nor additional services charged the room so far.  She then looked it up again and said that it has to do with a housekeeping charge and she would call the manager to come in and explain.  I was already confused at that point what housekeeping charge she was referring to.When she came back a few minutes later, the same lady told me that she is the manager in charge (weird, considering she said she was looking for the manager a few minutes ago) and that she has a report from housekeeping that my room need to undergo Deep Cleaning the previous day because I made a huge mess on the bed and thus the hotel charged me USD 500 for it.  I was really confused at that time and told her that the room was completely fine when my family left the room on the first day with only normal housekeeping to do.  She said the housekeeping even took a photo of it.  I was so shocked about this allegations and asked to see the photo.  She came in the office and came back out with the photo (See 1st photo attached), showing the bed sheets and pillows were stained by dirt.I said to the lady that I am absolutely sure that I and family did not do this.  And the lady just kept on saying \"I'm sorry sir, but the housekeeping had the proof and you have to pay for the deep cleaning\".  After going back and forth for 5 minutes and repeating that me and my family did not do it ( and her insisting that the hotel had proof that we did it), I asked her to proof that the photo is from our room (as the photo could have been taken from any room) and asked for a cctv proof how long did the Housekeeper cleaned our room to prove that she really did a deep cleaning....because on the previous day when we came back to our room in the evening after dinner we didn't see any unusual cleaning done to our room and we were not even notified about the deep cleaning when we came back on the previous night.  So i asked that she really made sure and investigate if this is really our room.  At this time, my and my wife felt really embarrased in front of other people in the lounge and felt like a criminal who lied..and the way she talked to us made us feel as such as she was really sure that we did it and lied about it.So she went away again for another 5 minutes to get further proof. To make things worse, while she went away, another Autograph Lounge front desk staff standing next to our stall (named Tim) told us \"If you guys keep on doing this, she may call Security and you guys may be ousted from all Marriott Properties\".  We were very very shocked by this demeaning comment and felt accused.  It was a complete, perfect Fait Accompli to something that we did not do.   But we felt confident that we did not do it, so we kept on arguing to give us proof that it was our room.After 5 minutes of wait in deep confusion as to what just happened, the same lady (who now professed that she is the manager in charge), informed us \"Sir, we just found out that the photo we just showed you was in your room but was not done by you, but instead by the previous guest that stayed in the room before you checked in and the housekeeper had to do a deep cleaning to your room.  the photo was taken at 11 am on 23rd December, and you only checked in at 8pm at night on 23rd December, so it is definitely not you...We apologized for that\"  She waived our first 2 nights as a compensation to this mistake and apologized.  We told her okay, but please do not do this Cruel thing to people ever again as this is very hurtful.We were relieved at the time and appreciated the recovery gesture, but was still very emotional about the incident even until now (a day later).  Despite the money compensation, we still feel slighted by how sure they were that we were wrong and how they did not go into deeper investigation about the photo if we did not fight and argue hard for it.  It really ruined the rest of our Christmas Day, my wife and I were completely speechless on what just happened during our late lunch that day (yes, our son was so hungry waiting for us arguing at the autograph lounge).  We felt disrespected, distrusted, and slighted.....especially for a loyal Platinum Elite Member (Which by the way does not mean much at this hotel, no breakfast provided either).On the evening, we proactively decided to report 2 other damages in the room that we tolerated since we checked in... so that we will not be charged again for something that we have not done.  See the 2nd and 3rd photos: (1) bathroom door handle that fell off and (2) wash basin that was cracked and hot water knob that did not turn/work.We also decided to take photo every time we leave the room (with recorded date and time of photo taken) so that we cannot be wrongly charged and accused again.We are still in dismay as to what happen to us until now and have a complete distrust of this Hotel management and how they handle this.  If the hotel thinks money compensation alone solves this problem...it doesn't work that way as we still feel the accusations still hurting our psyche and ruined our Christmas Day yesterday.So for other guests, PLEASE BEWARE.  The hotel can easily took random photos to accuse you of doing something that you have never done.  I definitely will not return to this hotel after my check out tomorrow...where I will continue to hopefully better treatments by other Marriott/SPG hotels (we stay in all Marriott/SPG properties throughout our 3 week holiday in the US ).  We have been treated well on the previous ones, but definitely VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED at this Cosmopolitan Las Vegas, which is a posh hotel yet with very bad management, system and attitude by the staff (those in charge of Platinum Elite Members too).I encourage other travellers to stay away from this hotel or at least beware of what this Hotel can do to ruin your holiday."

        "review_text": "We booked this hotel as just a one night, driving through Vegas on the way home kinda thing; so we went through a popular booking site and the rates were lower than many, so we went for it. What a mistake it was!It's in an unattractive part of town, and a pimp--honest to god!--real pimp--was sitting out in front when we pulled up.  But i's Vegas and this ain't our first rodeo, so in we went.Over the loud music and conversation from the bar (which opens onto the \"lobby\"), we had a hard time hearing our somber desk agent, Daniel. But we checked in, and started for the room, rolling our suitcases along the cracked walkway and up the steps to our \"suite\" set our expectations down a notch. The dirty sock sitting on the AC unit by our door was a clue. Hmmm. When we opened the door to the fetid warm air we stepped back! Whew! And then picked up our cases to get them over the furniture crowding the door! The couch was greasy grimy and saggy. The two double beds in the next room had 6\" between them! Husband scooted sideways between the bed and TV to turn on the AC. It didn't work. That was it--no way were we staying here. We pulled the living room table back out of the way, revealing months' worth of dirt and trash, but now we had a path to the door.Back in the lobby, Daniel was amazed to find we thought the room was awful. He didn't ask if he could switch us, apologize , or anything helpful or nice--just informed us that there was a 72 hour cancellation policy (handy--since we booked the evening before).A later email to the manager has gone unacknowledged. I have given up on getting my money back, but maybe I can save someone else from this pit.It seems to mostly be a low end extended stay place. Don't waste your time or money!"

        "review_text": "This is the third time for me to be in Honolulu, compare the the previous hotel's I stayed with, I would say everything was amazing about the Trump Hotel up to the point where I forgot my newly purchased Chanel wallet in the room before checked out. The second I found out I forgot the wallet, I immediately made a phone call to the hotel. Housekeeping was friendly and said they would look for me and email me once they find it. After 6 hours when I landed in LA, there was no Email and so I called again. Housekeeping then told me THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING in my room 2207, which is unbelievable. I clearly remember I placed the shopping bag inside which is a brand new Chanel wallet on the couch. I am pretty sure the shopping bag is BIG enough and it CAN'T BE POSSIBLY IGNORED! The housekeeping persons are really nice during my stay and I hate to call anyone a thief without further evidence. If anyone from the Trump Hotel sees this review, I'd like to be contacted and find out a solution for this lost item. Thank you!!!"

        "review_text": "The Jockey Club is a great hotel/timeshare not only for its nice d\u00e9cor, friendly staff but mainly for its location. It is nestled between the fabulous Bellagio and Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casinos. Also, because it is not a Casino you don't pay the resort tax which is about $25 a day per room.As timeshare owners we had vies of the strip and Bellagio fountains but I believe that is only available for owners, which is fair enough. The room we had was 908. It was a huge 2 bed apartment with 2 bathrooms,  an ample sized fully equipped kitchen and nice sized living area with a dining table and nice big TV. Housekeeping came every day to change the towels and changed the bedding once a week. This is more than most timeshare properties do so was a nice surprise.The hotel itself provides free coffee all day in the hospitality room as well as free popcorn during the day and free donuts every Friday morning. There is a small shop in the hotel which sells sodas, beers and snacks. Its not cheap but convenient. There is a Walgreens just across the strip that has a larger selection and also sells liquor.TIPS- They don't tell you when you book in but there is a elevator from the Jockey Club straight into the Cosmopolitan Casino. Walk out of the main building where the reception is and take the corridor past the valet booth. It is signposted as Cosmo Casino but it would be easily  missed. Walk through the car  park and you will see a set of elevators at the back. Take the lift to the 1st floor and you are in the casino.Another thing they don't tell you is that you can use the Cosmo bamboo pool. This is an amazing pool equipped with 2 bars, in pool, loungers and comfortable poolside beds. As we are not young and hip we liked going to the pool as soon as it opened at 8am. This is when normal people go who don't necessarily look good in a bikini or have a six pack. We had a look at the pool in the afternoon and it was like a scene from a teen movie. Lots of posing and not much swimming. So as I say \"normal\" people get there early which also means you get the best loungers. To get to the pool come out of the Jockey Club Cosmo elevators and go right. Travel trough some slot machines towards the check-in desk. You will see some elevators to your left. Take the second or third set to the 14th floor. Make sure you take your Jockey Club key card with you and just show that at the towel desk for your towels and entry.Another good tip is to use the Cosmo taxi service.  If you ask the Valet at the Jockey Club it will more than likely be a private taxi they will get you and I am not comfortable with how they charge so always go for a Las Vegas standardised taxi. Follow my instructions on how to get to the pool but instead of taking the elevators, keep going towards the exit and the taxi rank is on the right hand side. The attendant is very helpful in getting you a cab fit for your needs.Lastly the Jockey Club is located right next to a Deuce stop. The Deuce is the 24 hour bus that runs the length of the Strip, all the way to Fremont Street for $8 a day. If you come out of reception and take a right at the road you will reach a small lane that takes you to the strip. The Deuce stop is on the strip just to your left. You can buy tickets at the machine or if you have the right money, on the bus."

There are other hotels in the area in this price range that are subtly chic.  Such a shame that this building was given such an unfortunate remodel."

        "review_text": "When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by super friendly staff.\u00a0 After walking in we got a nice complementary drink and a traditional indian necklace. We booked a room with a view of the Kalifa and an extra request was to have a room as high as possible. They really looked at our wish and put us on the 31th floor were our view on the burj kalifa is really superb.\u00a0 I had an extra request for my wife's birthday and when we arrived at our room... they did. The room is amazing... the bed is real king size and our bathroom with tub is great.\u00a0 Walking to the window and see the Burj Kalifa from ceiling to floor is the extra wow factor of the room to make it complete. The room is new and everything is digital\u00a0 adjustable. The news paper is at the door in the morning and when you are ready for it you can enjoy a big full breakfast. From a cold salad bar to nice warm english or Arabic breakfast... they have it all.The staff is super friendly and helpfull. There is even a shuttle bus going to the Dubai Mall. When you are in Dubai and you look for a nice good hotel... i really recommend the Taj."

        "review_text": "It takes a really bad experience for me to write a review. So take the time to read this before you book this hotel. You should book this hotel for its location we have been looking for a location like this for our annual New Years holiday. That can become somewhere we can come every year without fail. Regardless of how you feel about the other reviews here you should the look to its next door neighbour and book there instead. I expect a 5 star resort not to have behaviour like a package holiday. I expect when a hotel takes the time to make clear hotel policy to guests by printing out a card to explain how the pool area is used the hotel ensure that is how it is conducted. I don't expect to be told oops sorry you went by the rules too bad even though you were up early enough and saw the pool area was empty so you were not worried. Come here if you like but expect poor mannered pool etiquette and a staff that clearly don't care. As relaxing by the pool is the first thing you do on holiday. This hotel failed hard and fast for me. It's the Royal Hawaiian next door for me next year."

Over the years we have stayed in many hotels here among them the Ritz-Carlton, Westin,The Palace, Intercontinental, Stanford Court, and Grand Hyatt. There are many quality options in San Francisco of course, but nothing compares in our minds to Hotel Nikko. Starting with the ease of dropping your car at the downstairs valet parking, to the escalator ride up into the breathtaking and vast white marble lobby, continuing with the superior service throughout your stay, gorgeous and comfortable rooms, and terrific city views, your stay here is a very special one indeed. We were upgraded to a corner suite on our last visit-- one of the best rooms we'ver ever experienced in San Francisco. As if all this weren't enough, this is hands down the best located luxury hotel to the center of the action in the city. We have found our favorite, and you will too!"

        "review_text": "The old Post Office in DC is an iconic building. I had hoped that the integrity of the building would be considered in the design. The gold and Trump name splashed all over the property is terrible. At check in the staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was comfortable but the bed and accents more cheap gold and the Trump name on everything. Decided to have a quick bite and drink. Tried the house wine and had to send it back. It seemed like it had been open for awhile. Maybe because the hotel didn't seem to have many guests. I had a burger which was ok nothing special. I had mentioned that I had a meeting to attend and the server assured me that they could rush the order. But I had to remind the server twice and just barely made it to my meeting. When I returned from my meeting my room had not been made up. It was 4pm so I just told them not to even bother. Maybe they are trying to work the kinks out but this was not a first class hotel. Next time I will stay at the Four Seasons."

        "review_text": "This was our first visit to this beautiful hotel . You couldn't ask for a better location to be in the heart of SF . Everything you ever need or want is pretty much in walking distance , and if you aren't into walking, public transportation is a stones throw away . Being born and raised in the bay area I have never really thought to stay over night in the city. Home is only About 45 min away . Decided to take a night away with my little ones to kick off spring break. The decor and vibe of the hotel is something to be desired . Feels like a boutique hotel in NYC, swanky upbeat feel . In the afternoon the bar and game room is pretty quiet , by come 6 its alive with all kinds of people . We had dessert in the restaurant, kids had cake , mommy had a Moscow mule . We walked around the game room a little and admired the unique art on the walls and ceilings of the hotel. Best part .... Not a sound in the evening. If only Rest was this pleasurable at home hahaha . I expected at least some street noise as we have two large windows in the room, NOTHING . And there were many cars going by, my son enjoyed watching them all pass by. Great food and shopping right as you walk out the doors. The beds comfortable, room clean, plenty of towels/toiletries and space within the room . Next in line will be to have an adult night with the husband so we can enjoy the night life this place has to offer ;)"

        "review_text": "First off, I would like to disclose that I DO NOT like to leave negative reviews. However, I was so disappointed with my previous stay at the Intercontinental SF, and the lack of follow up on behalf of the manager of the property considering we are part of the Intercontinental Ambassador program, that I am still very upset and dissatisfied with their service.About a little over a year ago, we stayed 4 nights at the Intercontinental in Room 3019, our favorite room. We were absolutely delighted with our stay and were very eager to find reason to return and explore more of San Francisco and stay at this property.This time around we hoped to replicate our previous stay, but unfortunately everything was a complete mess. It all started at check-in.1-They first placed us in a room different to the one we wanted: a King Corner similar to 3019. After waiting for over 45 minutes for our bags to arrive to the room, we had to go downstairs and retrieve them ourselves. In between the 45 minutes our bags were disregarded in the lobby, my blazer fell off the trolley and was picked up by housekeeping. I did not realize my blazer was missing until my last day, while I was packing my bag. More on that later.2-We requested a change of room, and they moved us to the room from hell: #2819. The mattress needed immediate replacing and the room was smelling musty besides the LINGERING SURPRISED THAT AWAITED FOR ME UNDER MY BED. (See photo)3-The few times I attempted to use the concierge at the hotel I was snubbed. I needed reservations at some popular restaurants, and they would refuse to call because they  knew that the restaurants would be fully committed. This is Unacceptable.  While I understand a popular restaurant may be committed I expected my concierge to at least TRY, I also expect my concierge to have a strong relationship with popular and new restaurants, bars, etc.Another time I tried to use the concierge, they were unable to find me tickets to Alcatraz for the Ai Wei Wei exhibit; this was important for me to see as I specialized in Chinese Contemporary Art. After being snubbed once again, I went down to the wharf and found out that they sell tickets at 8 am every morning for the first boat. Luckily I did not take no for an answer and was able to experience the Ai Wei Wei exhibit on its last day. How the concierge was resisted to share this wealth of information I still do not know.I will note during our last stay here they were so much more efficient and helpful, and we were here during Christmas!!!4-To wrap up this stay at the Intercontinental SF, we requested a late check out after coming back from Alcatraz and having Lunch at the Slanted Door. (Something else the concierge deemed impossible even though I only waited 10 minutes for a table)As I was packing I realized, my blazer was missing.During my search, I discovered a SEXTOY and an obviously DIRTY CONDOM underneath the corner of our bed.HOW CAN THIS HAVE HAPPENED?5-While finally checking out of the hotel downstairs and sharing my recent discovery with the agent at the front desk, I asked about my missing blazer.She called Housekeeping, who declined finding a blazer. I asked for her to call security instead, who said housekeeping did in fact find a blazer. Someone is lying here...In short, I HAD to suggest for them to review their cameras in order to find a solution and after almost an hour the jacket was returned, with stains, but returned.Now, almost a month later, we have yet to receive an apology for this nightmare of a stay.Is this what luxury hotel stays have become?After an experience like this, despite how great my first visit was, the Intercontinental SF will probably not see me again."

        "review_text": "I stayed here with a friend.   I live in Oakland but we wanted to do some city things so we got a last minute deal for one night at Hotel Zetta.  Arrived after a harrowing 2 hour detour through the city (because of St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade) and when we finally checked in we could not have felt more welcome.  They even sent us up to our room with a complimentary bottle of wine since the lobby bar was not yet open.  Our room was wonderful.  The d\u00e9cor is hip with a mix of retro and modern.  Rooms are small but that is expected in SF.  What\u2019s not expected is to have such a nice, modern, big bathroom (we were in Room 514).  I\u2019ve stayed at some of the other \u201cluxury\u201d hotels in San Francisco (The Palace and The Fairmont) and they were not half as nice.  It is a perfect location if you\u2019re planning downtown/Union Square sightseeing/events/shopping \u2013 very central and easy access (when there is not a parade going through town)."

        "review_text": "I came to Kahala to get away. My room faced out to the ocean, so my first thought was how beautiful it was until I noticed the pool down below. Within the small tank were several dolphins swimming in circles looking bored and disillusioned. I did not want this to happen yet the view ruined my hopes of relaxing. I could not stop looking at how dirty the tiny pool was in comparison to the vastness of their neighbor, the ocean. I hope the Kahala resort loses the dolphins in captivity; this aspect of their resort is a game changer when it could be a much better place."

        "review_text": "We have stayed here several times without finding the hotel anything special other than its position if you want to have access to the main part of Waikiki. On our recent visit last week our views of this hotel being overrated, more than expensive and service extremely poor were simply confirmed and we will not be staying at this establishment again. Everyone we speak to who travel extensively say for them its the best of a bad lot of Waikiki hotels but am sure if we try hard enough we will find one that appreciates our patronage and delivers far superior service and accommodation. One positive was that when we arrived late morning 2 of our 3 rooms (we travelled with family) were ready. The newspaper delivered to my room was a Japanese paper and since we are Australian was useless for me. I called down at 5pm explaining we required an English print newspaper and were promised it immediately. An hour later still no paper so called again - many apologies - and that we would have the paper sent straight away. Needless to say it wasn't delivered at all that evening and after calling again at 11pm was told the matter would be reported to the manager! All over a simple newspaper?? Next morning at the buffet breakfast which was part of our package my wife asked for a second coffee and the response was \"since your husband didn't have a coffee you can have the second without charge\". The following morning I made the mistake of ordering coffee so when my wife requested a second we were told we would have to pay extra for it even though we had breakfast included in our rate. I said to the waitress/manager that my wife would like the second coffee irrespectively however felt it an absolute disgrace that I was paying approx. us$1800/night for the family and they were going to charge us for a second coffee. The response was \"some people have 4 coffees so we have to put a stop to it somewhere\"!!! What a joke when charges at the hotel are so extremely high in the first place.! The Halekulani has seen the very last of my family and would suggest that anyone reading this review should stay elsewhere where they wont feel rorted by a hotel that tries to grab every penny from their guests. They should feel ashamed of themselves."

        "review_text": "I was so disappointed with my stay at the Trump DC Hotel. This beautiful historic building has been ruined with tacky gold letters at the front entrance and the day I arrived graffiti. The integrity of the architecture was ruined by the Trump restoration. So sad. At check in the staff was professional but cold. I requested an early check in but was denied. Not sure why because the hotel was not busy except for tourists taking pictures. Headed to the bar and was encouraged to try Trump house wine. Wow big mistake. The bartender gave me something better on the house. Time for check in the room was ok but more tacky gold and Trump plastered on everything. I travel to DC frequently.  I ordered room service which was very average nothing special. The St Regis, Fairmont, Ritz, Kimpton are all far superior."

        "review_text": "I have been to DC a number of times.  I have stayed at The Jefferson, Four Seasons and the Hay Adams, all of which were wonderful.  As a preservation architect, I was truly looking forward to staying at the new Trump International DC.  I have always loved this historic building and was excited that it was being rehabbed into a hotel.  I assumed this would be a wonderful stay, but boy was I wrong!It is impressive at first when you walk into the atrium lobby, but that's where it ends.My family and I had a terrible experience.  The walls obviously must have no soundproofing whatsoever and the windows don't block out the considerable street noise.  I am a very light sleeper and ,between the noise from within and without, I was unable to enjoy uninterupted sleep for any of the 4 nights of our stay.  Fortunately, the children are able to sleep through anything so they weren't disturbed.The service and the restaurant were not much better.  I guess I've been spoiled by my expectations of what 5 star hotel food and service should be.  I know the hotel opened only recently and it may take a while for management to get its act together, but when I am paying for 5 star service, I expect to get what I'm paying for and this experience fell far well short.I will be returning in DC in several months on business and I can assure you, I will not be coming back to this place anytime soon."

        "review_text": "I make an annual trip to Vegas to play poker.  I usually stay at Harrahs, Linq, Monte Carlo, etc.  I got tired of the resort fee games that these properties are playing, which now cost close to $40 a day.  In past trips, I would walk past Best Western/Casino Royale and wonder what it would be like to stay there.  This year we gave them a try.  We were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are very convenient to the strip, no walking all the way to the back of a casino to get to elevators.  Although it is in a busy chokepoint on the strip, the sound from outside is well insulated by a secured glass door.  We were in room 102 which means we were in the closest room to the casino and on the ground floor.  The room is a bit tight but we got used to it during our 11 day stay.   Beds were comfortable.  Location is great, across the street from the Mirage and between a Harrahs and Venetian.  Dining options are great for budget conscious travelers.  McDonalds, Chipotle, Panda Express, Denny\u2019s, White Castle, and other Hot Dog and pizza stands were all close.  At check-in, i arrived on a very early flight.  The front desk was very friendly and told me they should have my room ready by 11:00, even though check-in time is 4:00 per my reservation.  They tried to get me in earlier but the length of my stay didn\u2019t give them any options.  They held my baggage and had my room ready when I came back at 11:00.  They let me check in and didn\u2019t ask for any early check in fee.  I have had to pay Harrahs $30 for early check-in in the past.  When I checked out this morning, the front desk was very friendly, asked me how I liked my stay, and advised me no charges were due.  This is how Vegas hotels need to treat their guests.  I will come back."

        "review_text": "There are so many wonderful, classy hotels in DC, so just pass this one by.  It is not worth the price.  The employees don't look very happy or look like they care about patrons.  Yes, the rooms are fine, but no better than other hotels that are much cheaper.  My favorite is the Fairmont.  They often run AAA promotions that make them half the cost of the Trump."

        "review_text": "We were not told we were given a \"smoking floor\" room.  My wife has a cigarette smoke allergy.  That is the headline.  Here is the full story.We live locally on Oahu.  I planned an escape for me and my wife to celebrate her coming birthday as well as some desperately needed time alone (we have a 5 yr old and 9 yr old).  Having never stayed on the Kahala coast before, I though The Kahala would be perfect.  A VERY nice lady helped us get a good price on a room that would normally be well above our budget.  During the conversation, she said she had given us an upgrade to a partial ocean view/golf course view (the Sony Open was this weekend) on a high floor.  I said, \"great, thank you so much\".  No mention of a smoking room or floor.Upon check in, another VERY nice person told us we had been given another upgrade to an Ocean  View room on the 10th floor.  We could not have been happier.  No mention of this being a smoking room and a smoking floor.Everyone was so nice and the interior of the lobby was spectacular, though.We arrived at our room and as the door was opened I was hit with a pretty strong and nasty whiff of old cigarette.  My wife entered and we sat down.  The room was very, very nice.  The bathroom, bed, decor and furniture were beautiful.  The carpet looked  in need of replacement and the couch was filthy around the bottom.  The cigarette smell seemed to grow as we sat.  My wife almost immediately began to itch and I sent her to the balcony as I called the front desk.  I was surprised to find out they had a smoking floor (the 10th).  I told them the situation and they immediately moved us to another room.  Sadly, my wife's condition did not improve.  It became clear we needed to leave and fast, before she needed to use her EpiPen.  Another surprise was the manager saying we had not requested a NON SMOKING room on our reservation.   I told him I did not think smoking was allowed in hotels anymore AND that I did not remember a place to choose either a smoking or non smoking room on the room reservation pages on line.He then said he was willing to not charge us for our second day but that he would have to charge us one day as we were inside their 72 hour cancellation window.  I said that I could see that if we were simply changing our minds.  However, no one told us we were going into a smoking room.  The situation was directly related to this error - an error the hotel made, not us.  I told him we had to go, no matter what.  If he had to charge us, while i did not think it right nor fair, we would have to accept it as I needed to get my wife out of there ASAP (yes, we could faintly smell cigarettes even in the new room).  As my wife began to panic, I raced her out of there.  The manager said he could not make a final decision, as he needed to talk to a higher headquarters and he did not know if anyone would be there at this time of day.  Left unasked was my question as to what good is being the manager if you cannot make decisions such as this one.  I gave him my cell phone as I needed to know the final outcome as soon as possible.  He finally called as we were driving home to ask if we wanted to accept their one day charge and they would give us a \"free\" night in the future - so long as it was within 3 months.  After MUCH back and forth I finally convinced him that we would really just like our money back.  My wife could not conceive of going back there and being able to relax, wondering if or when cigarette smoke would creep up and make her ill.Make of this what you will.  I cannot say enough about how nice the reservation, bell, valet staff were.  You can draw your own conclusions about the rest.  We wont be back, sadly."

        "review_text": "After nearly two years of insane business travel, I came to Honolulu for work and booked an extra night, in an Ocean View Premium room at the Lotus, as  treat to myself.  The reservation, of course, had a cancellation policy that guaranteed the hotel one night of revenue if I should cancel late, or no-show.So I was shocked and dismayed when I arrived at the hotel and my room category was sold out. And, instead of being offered an UPgrade, which I've had happen in similar scenarios in the past, the only option I was given was to DOWNgrade.  So the entire reason I had booked this hotel, and my entire \"treat\" to myself, was instantly destroyed.You clearly CANNOT COUNT ON THE LOTUS TO PROVIDE THE ROOM CATEGORY YOU'VE  RESERVED, GUARANTEED, OR PAID FOR.This kind of overbooking (followed by DOWNgrading) when a hotel would have penalized ME for not showing, is simply insane.  I'm sure this happens at other hotels as well, as they try to maximize their revenue streams at the risk of screwing their guests.  But I've never had it happen quite like this.The only reason I didn't give a \"one star\" review was because the room *was* clean and comfortable.  Too bad it wasn't the experience I had reserved."

        "review_text": "I read ALL the reviews on this hotel after I booked. Typically, we stay at any of the Category 6 and higher Marriotts or the Fairmont. This time, based on what was available for packages, I chose this location for the cleanliness rating, courteous service, quiet factor compared to all other touristy hotels, and proximity to waikiki beach.The value (worked out to less that $100 per person per night by booking Air Canada Vacation package 6 months in advance) for what we received was worth it. Our 210 square foot room (1208) was a corner suite with an unobstructed ocean view Juliette balcony and a spacious partial ocean view, partial mountain view facing the Aston Waikiki hotel. Bathroom is spacious and has plenty of counter space. On the 12th floor, the noise level from the Lulu bar below on a Saturday night is barely audible. Very peaceful. Toiletry amenities were very nice. Plenty of clean dresser drawers and a good size closet with luggage rack for storing your clothes.Yes, the balcony chairs are a bit dusty but I simply covered them with dollar store rain ponchos and that's where I hung our wet beachwear to dry overnight.The bedside lamps have two plug-ins each in case you like having mobile devices, readers, iPads, and such plugged in near your head.In the welcome material for your room, it states that linens are changed on every 3rd night of your stay. You can talk to housekeeping if you need other arrangements.We booked Scuba Diving (intro) and the Roberts Hawaii Pearl Harbour/North Shore day trip tour with the Expedia agent located in the lobby. She was very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful (as with all staff at Parkshore). They offer good rates but only take credit card. Coming from Canada, the exchange rate (1.22, currently) is bit of an owie but the discount via Expedia offsets and there is value. Don't forget to bring extra cash to tip your tour director/driver.Beach towels and beach chairs were plentiful and readily available when you exchanged your beach card. We also enjoyed the pool area which was never crowded; at most, 80% occupancy on any given day and perfect view of the beach without actually being on the beach.If you want hotel room service for food, there is none. However, there is a service available with a list of places that will delivery to your door for a small service charge. We never used this as there are endless number of places to eat within walking distance, and open very late to cater to tourists, and large american sized servings. We gave away our doggie bags to some of the homeless people sleeping near the beach. There aren't many, but a few who have been forced out of their homes by rising apartment rental rates.They don't cause any trouble to tourists, and their are daily outreach workers who help support them. A local police presence is also right on the beach.No gym, but there is a 24 hour fitness located 2 blocks away on the main strip. The hotel can provide a pass for $15, or you can buy a weekly pass at the gym for $69 which offers a locker and access to showers whenever you want. Great for cleaning off at the beach or storing your wallets/valuables.There is a no-charge in room safe that is easy to use, and mini-fridge below it. We shopped a few blocks inward at Food Pantry for ready made salads, cheese and crackers, for midday snacks. The hotel offers complimentary early morning coffee water and juice midday until early evening in the lobby. Bring your water bottle/coffee thermos and get your free refills there.We met the manager, Scott Pauli, at the one hour, pre-sunset meet and greet on Wednesday, on the pool deck. Staff pours alcoholic and non-alcoholic champagne punch and serves up light savoury treats (e.g., maui chips, pretzel mix) while the manager comes around to introduce himself, asks how your stay has been, and for your feedback. Our only comment was that we would like to see blue recycle bins in hotel rooms for plastic water bottles, newspapers, etc. The trash bins are small and the housekeeping staff have to manually sort through our garbage for recycling.I booked an Island Express shuttle via the hotel to take us back to the airport on friday night. It is $13 per person with cash collected at the end of your ride. Cheaper than the $35 flat rate fare that is usually offered by taxis. The shuttle is a 10 person-seating van and arrives in a timely fashion, on the :45 every hour provided that you book through concierge.Our check out time was at noon, so we stored our luggage, ambled about, relaxed at poolside, went out for one last dinner and sunset, and then waited a couple hours in the nice lobby to charge up our mobile devices. There is access to bathrooms and a hospitality suite so you can change back into winter clothing :)I would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys friendly service, a comfortable bed with nice view, clean towels and big bathroom, a \"quieter\" experience compared to other Waikiki hotels, and value for their money. The noise is everywhere as it is a major tourist hub and that can't be avoided unless you head away from Waikiki. To create the \"Fairmont\" type of indulgence, I booked a spa treatment at the Westin Moana Surfrider. It's a 10 minute walk away without the quadrupled hotel room bill. For eats, Tucker and Bevvy is convenient for a quick and nutritious smoothie, but Jamba Juice is a mere few feet away and always has coupons or a promotion (buy one get one free; check the star advertiser daily, or ask for a coupon when they provide samples). Starbucks is open until midnight, but if you walk further down 15 minutes to the main hub of activity, there are a couple artisanal coffee houses with better tasting lattes.Tips: The Saturday KCC (Kapiolani Community College) Farmer's Market is a 15 minute walk away, or you can catch a bus right outside the hotel. Worth it for the authentic Loco Moco and artisanal, locally made eats. Diamond Head, round-trip from hotel to crater and back on foot with a stop off at the park for Shave Ice and a burger is 2.5 hours. It's a 30 minute walk from the hotel to the no-charge US Army museum. You can take the bus back, but the walk along the beach with a stop off for dole whip or Honolulu Cookie sampling is worth it.Some reviewers commented that the rooms are not cleaned well, too small, too loud, bad view, not getting what they want, service unresponsive....first, you arrived safely in Waikiki. That should be a good start. You are steps away from a beautiful beach - that's the perfect view you should enjoy outside, and not from your window, although that is a plus. Ocean front is nice, but not necessary. If you want housekeeping to do more, talk to the manager any time, or at the wednesday reception and voice your concerns. If the balcony chairs are too dirty, ABC Stores are on every block for a 2 square mile radius, walking distance. Cover it down with a beach towel or plastic and then sit on it...or, perhaps use a small towel and wipe it down. Lots of things one can do to make their stay more enjoyable, but at it was, for us it was perfect.Thanks to the staff at Park Shore for helping make this trip so seamless and enjoyable."

        "review_text": "Before you decided to go and stay there please read my own experience:02-October-2016 at 3am in the morning we got called desk phone calling from connecting front desk. Since we were sleeping, we didn't talk much but saying \" I am Cambodian\" and hung up the phone. Again, the phone ringing again, then we picked up but not listen. We just placed in on table to make sure it was not ringing again.Then someone knocking the door and rang the bell. We asked in our Khmer language \" who's that?\" Then there was a lady voice answered but we could not identify and get what she said. Then we asked in EnglishWe asked:\" who's that?\"She replied: \"open the door\"We replied: \"wrong room, I will call the police\"She replied: \"ok call the police\"In this situation, we didn't expect any visit from anyone. Cos we had no friends or relative in bangkok.Then while were we on phone with front desk service she kept knocking the door.\"Temporary solution the front desk staff asked the security to check for us. But then none of them came and confirmed us back. Only call and tell.We requested for CCTV in the morning by 8:30am but they seemed didn't do what we requested. They gave us stupid reasons and excuses by not letting us to see the CCTV Like signal problem, the lady was too short to be seen, camera not clear and so on.Finally, the staff asked us to report to the police before checking CCTV. She lied to us again and again since the beginning with many excuses. Finally we cancelled the hotel and changed to the new one.You can find me by my name as the guest on 30 sep 2016 to 01 October 2016. Kol sovanrithy"

        "review_text": "I stayed for a week in this hotel as a last minute stay for work and this was the only hotel that had rooms left.  Now I know why.  The hotel itself looks so much nicer in the photos.  It's very cheaply furnished and screams\"cheesy\".  It looks like that cheap Medieval Times  dinner theater that people used to go to in the 80's.  I could probably get past the decor if the rooms were comfortable or if the service was good, but it was neither.  The bed was extremely uncomfortable, I don't know if it was made of horse hair or what.  My back hurt for a week. The service was horrendous.  Do yourself a favor and stay and the Four Seasons or the Gaylord (a little further out of the city, but well worth it.)"

Lisa Zwissler with beach bum vacation booked this for us and it was just what we needed for one night - place to crash and clean up. Great value and very helpful staff. Rooms are outdated but we were given access to a hospitality suite after we had checked out which was super convienent and helpful before heading to the airport."

        "review_text": "My family and I stayed at the Trump DC in May for three , we were excited, for Travel Agent FAM. We couldn't wait to review and book this hotel to our clients. Well upon check-in our room was not ready and we told the front desk manager we were going to get lunch at the Benjamin bar, he told us to enjoy and that Lunch would be on him, my wife looked at him and said you know there are five of us? we had our three daughters with us, he said Yes enjoy. Well at the end of our lunch, which was very poor our waitress was not trained at all, we got up to leave and they wouldn't bring us a bill to sign they just said it's all taken care of. Well an hour later I got a call from the front desk manager telling me that my bill was $700 and he needs me to come down and pay half!? I said what? I told him to send somebody up with a copy of the bill so I could review, and you know even if it was $700 that's not my fault that they're charging exorbitant amounts of money for lunch. No one ever came up with the bill so my wife and I went down to the front desk and asked to see the bill, he brought us out the bill and here there were several items on the bill we never ordered or received and drinks! Well the waitress was clearly padding the bill for her tip. We pointed this out to Amanda and he just stared at us and wouldn't say anything it was very weird. It was like to the point where we didn't understand if he understood English. Clearly you can see how our excitement to visit the Trump DC was quickly turned into disbelief.  I called Trump client care and I received a call that the general manager wanted to meet with us in the morning I made special arrangements to go down and meet with the manager only to have The GM ignore the reason for the meeting. He did not even want to address the lunch situation! I was forced to bring up the situation and the total insult put upon me and my family. His only answer was don't worry about the bill it's taken care of. It was so weird and so disappointing he did offer us a apology. He did offer us a private tour of the belltower which was nice. As far as the room goes it was a nice room but the housekeeping was horrible, pubic hair in the tub, dirt on the plates. And then when we left the hotel to go visit the sites we had a stroller for my youngest and tried to use the handicap entrance ramp and the door wouldn't work and the Bellman would not come down to help with door,so I had to walk back up and carry my daughter in the stroller up the steps bumping into people walking in and out of the hotel while the Bellman stared at us! It was insane, it was staffed and trained like a Third World country management company. The one morning we were walking out and my wife wanted a coffee, a lady said she would get it for her, dropped the cup on the floor picked it up and poured coffee in it and my wife had to tell her she would like a clean cup!? it was weird and poor quality. The day we checked out we asked to talk to a manager because they didn't do anything for us on our bill with all the trouble and issues we had, it is customary a hotel will comp you some nights and stuff due to all issues we experienced , our whole stay should've been Comped it was that ridiculous. I told them not to charge my card until I hear from the manager because they told us all the managers were in a meeting, they were always in meetings. After check out a bellhop came up to us telling us to come to an elevator which he stopped just for us and stuffed  us in this elevator where a lady with her kids was waiting,even though there were two other elevators it was really weird we went downstairs it was pouring down rain so we went up the handicap ramp where the door didn't work so I had to stand there and hold the door open in the rain for this lady and my wife and family. Valet  parked the car not under the roof, but outside the roof so we got poured on  loading our car.  I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this experience I just hope that somehow I can get a message to the Trump family because there's no way this is up to Trump Organization standard. We have stayed at trump properties before and this DC property SUCKED. As you can read here I am quite mad because I expect more from the Trump brand so I'm hoping Don Jr. reads this. We were so looking forward to this stay, I can't find the words to tell you how disappointed we were and still are. This is never been resolved it's just festering.   I was told that the GM was going to get in touch with me several times after we got back home only to be lied to and never heard from this incompetent fool ever! I had actual appointments set aside to take his scheduled call and he never called! This is how unprofessional this man is."

The receptionist wouldn\u2019t stop talking when all we wanted to do was check in.  I booked an ocean view but because I was trying to check in early there only was room that had a partial view. Partial at best, I had to go onto my balcony and look to only see a small view of the ocean between two all buildings.  The staff never said anything about renovations and construction starting at 7am and I had to use earplugs in the morning.Room fairly small . Bathroom was TINY.  The sink was not even in the bathroom.  It was in the room.  Bed was comfortable\u2014That\u2019s about it as far as room goes.Pool/ Lounge area was Decent.  Small pool with limited chairs. Service was sub par.Would not stay here again especially for the price ."

        "review_text": "I was bitten by a bed bug in room 1105 on the first night at the Comfort Inn By the Bay in San Francisco, CA.  It was about 1:15 in the morning on April 26, 2016.  I woke up in pain with raised rashes on my left arm and behind my left ear.  My sister and I searched the bed and found a bed bug crawling on the bed sheet.  We managed to put the bed bug in a plastic bag and sealed it.  Immediately after, we went down to the front desk and spoke to Soontara.  We showed her the live bed bug in the bag and described the situation to her.  She took pictures of the bed bug, bug bites, and offered me eight Alcohol Swabs and a Comfort Care lotion.  I explained to her that I was seen and provided Mometasone Furoate Cream by Dr. Ting in room 1103.  Soontara wrote Jarrod Manna (FD Mgn) and Michael K. (GM) on a Comfort Inn by the Bay business card and told me she will send an email to the manager.  We then asked to change to another room, and Soontara switched us to room 1109.Around 7:30 AM \u2013 accompanied by my sister and Dr. Ting \u2013 we went to the front desk and spoke with Mr. Jarrod Manna in person.  I described my experience and showed him the bug bites and the bed bug.  He filed an incident report and told me that the insurance company will contact me.  There was never an apology! I was not happy about how he handled the entire situation; therefore, I sent him an email shortly after our conversation.  Again, there was no apology!Ms. Jessica Bouchey from the insurance company contacted me at 2:11pm on April 26, 2016.  She took some information from me about the incidence and asked me to email her the bug bite pictures and my email to Mr. Manna, which I did many times.  Ms. Bouchey claimed she did not receive the pictures, so I resent the pictures several more times during the business hours and asked her to confirm.  However, there was no reply.  On the morning of April 27, 2016, I forwarded the bug bite pictures and my email to Mr. Manna to Ms. Bouchey again.  Finally, Ms. Bouchey replied that she received the pictures.I understand that each hotel has its own policy.  However, when I presented the live bed bug and showed the front desk manager my severely inflamed, swollen, itchy, and painful skin from the bug bites that cover almost my entire left forearm, all he could say was to wait for the investigation.  There was never an apology!  I do not understand why I have to wait for the investigation.  A live bed bug, bug bites, and eight witnesses are not enough!? The evidence is there!  What else does the hotel need?  Furthermore, why do I have to deal with the company\u2019s insurance?  It should be dealt between the hotel and the insurance company.  My job is to provide the information, which I did many times.  Why do I have to wait for a week long (at least) investigation?  I am just a tourist and a guest at the Comfort Inn by the Bay!This bed bug bites incidence totally ruined my vacation.  My left arm covers with huge raised rashes and is in serious pain.  It is itchy, hot, and hard.  I could not lift my left arm much because it is so painful!  The manager of this hotel only follows the hotel\u2019s \u201cestablished procedures\u201d (his own words).  He has no genuine concern towards his guest.If anyone is planning to visit San Francisco in the future, I strongly advise to seek elsewhere for your stay.  Comfort Inn By the Bay is definitely not the choice!"

        "review_text": "I expected more. And for the price, so should everyone else.Had a deal to celebrate, so a bunch of us went down to Vegas and rented an MGM SkyLoft as our home base.Yes, the room is cool - but nothing overly spectacular and I found it underwhelming in truth. The concierge is lovely, helpful - but the rest of the services are rather...meh.The butler service, or at least - the lady we had been assigned - irritated me most. A person assigned to be on call wasn't all that happy to be. She mostly rolled her eyes and/or made a sarcastic remark at every request we made to navigate the room, services or preferences, giving us all the sense that you had bothered her every single time you asked for something, then also found the nerve to stand with her hand rather pointedly outstretched and eyes elsewhere before she left, only to come back next time with the same rolled eyes and comment routine, regardless of how much you might have tipped her.$1000+ per night should get you great services and access to the very best they have to offer. From access to clubs, pool cabanas and other services - when you pay the most you get the best. Not here.Renting a SkyLoft doesn't even get you complimentary, or even - paid access to their own Nightclubs, ffs.Want to go to Hakkasan? Get in line.Other than that, MGM SkyLoft is not a VIP experience you want to take your clients or celebrations to. Its just a big room with a separate elevator and thats where the VIP experience ends. Honestly, for the price - its a joke, quite like most MGM experiences.Shibuya is overpriced, has terrible service and disappointing fish. Hakkasan is an overcrowded cheeseball pit. The hotel is the same. Its all just way too large, impersonal, expensive, less than memorable but frankly, disappointing.Should have gone elsewhere. MGM is a never again for me."

        "review_text": "We received an email for a 5 day/4 night stay at Tahiti Village for $145 ($100 of which would be \"refunded\" after a timeshare presentation) Because this isn't our first timeshare experience, I knew what to expect....a 90 minute sale pitch about the value of spending time and making memories with my family (blah, blah, blah). However, these people take it to a whole new level (think used car salesman) Holy smokes! The appointment is scheduled for two hours (not 90 minutes like everyone else....they even make you initial the paperwork stating that you realize it's 2 hours long) So after 30 minutes of the sales rep showing us pictures of her family on her iPad (really?...stop wasting my time) and asking us the same questions multiple times, we get herded in a room to watch a video about Somerpointe Resorts (if you get really bored during this portion of the presentation, count the number of grammatically incorrect statements made on the video, it's cringeworthy) After the video, we heard about how we can travel the world, at all-inclusive, five star resorts for just $169 ( I seriously hope that no one believed this), but if buying a timeshare wasn't for us, they'd still shake our hands when we left (this was not exactly the goodbye we received.) After this, it was back to the table to be asked the same questions (for the third time) by our sales rep.After two hours and 15 minutes, my husband questioned the rep and remarked that the presentation was only supposed to be two hours long (at this point, we hadn't even toured the property, seen the rooms or \"crunched the numbers\"). The sales rep seemed very surprised that we weren't having the time of our lives and told us that we made a commitment that we needed to keep. We were also informed that if we didn't keep our (endless) appointment, we'd forfeit our gifts (actually just getting back $100 that I paid) and be responsible for the full price of the room. We agreed to continue. After the property tour and room viewing we sat back down at the table for the wheeling and dealing. If you do plan to purchase a timeshare, don't say yes right away because you won't believe the number of deals and discounts they'll pull out of thin air. Any thought of buying from Somerpointe disappeared when I realized how absolutely inconsiderate they are of people's time. After more than THREE hours we were finally set free....without a handshake or a thank you.I'm happy to report that we received our $100 gift, in the form of two show tickets and assume that we were charged the promotional room rate (unfortunately, I don't know this for sure since I have yet to receive my promised emailed receipt)If you are planning to attend a timeshare presentation, you may want to think twice, or at least consider blocking out a full day to do so.With all of that said, every other employee we encountered was very friendly and helpful. Unlike other reviewers, we had a painless check in and did not experience the dirty conditions that have been described. Our room was nice, but see the pictures I included for a better description of the things that could affect your stay.The pool/lazy river are both beautiful. However, we noticed a lack of enforcement of the no food/drinks policy. We saw MANY people bringing in coolers and bags full of alcohol and food. These items were consumed in plain view of hotel employees. Some guest were told that they couldn't have these items by the pool, while others were allowed to keep them. These were clearly items not sold at the pool bar or restaurant.Overall, we had a nice stay. It's a great place for families, but probably not the place to go if you want a quiet getaway."

We have done these in several countries and ate here to gamble so what the heck. We can see a property in case we come back here again.Property was ok. Price and incentives were good. We did a sampler package. Feeling happy, we went to a show then headed to the Casino Royale to gamble. We found out that the $300 was for playing on two banks of non paying old slots. Several others were there that took that incentive and all of us were pissed. We were lied to. Today we went back to that man that did this and he seemed shocked. Said it was a new incentive and he didn't know it was fake. Tomorrow he is supposed to get us genuine compensation. I guess we will see. I don't trust any of these people. This guy said he makes over a $100,000 a year giving out this to do those tours. Nice work huh? So, my advice? Just say NO in the first place. And now we HOPE what we bought is real...

We chose the Fairmont because of location to Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Golden Gate Bridge.  The location was perfect.  The hotel on the other hand was a different story.  The staff was awesome and brought us to our large room upon check in.  They brought us to our room and gave us a tour.  The room was very amazing and nicely decorated, however the room was poorly maintained.  There was mold around the ktichen sink, mold all over the shower floor, and around the bathtubs.  Yuck. The king headboard was falling apart and the polyester falling off.  The window coverings were in shams and were falling apart and ridiculous to try to open.  The window coverings were just disgusting and belonged in a 1 star, hourly motel.  The noise levels from the rooms above was extremely excessive.  I live in a high rise and have never experienced such loud noises and continuous walking throughout the night.While the location and the room layout were awesome, the lack of care shown on maintaining this hotel were less than desirable.  I would definitely not stay here again.  It's just not maintained enough to be a quality hotel and the noise levels in the evening was ridiculous.  To think I paid over $3000 for only four nights stay and I couldn't get out of the room fast enough."

        "review_text": "Once I booked our flights to Honolulu, I immediately began obsessing about which hotel to stay in.  Since it would be our first (and possibly only) trip to the area, I wanted it to be perfect.   I considered all of the top luxury properties in the area-- Halekulani, Moana Surfrider, Ritz Carlton, Trump, The Modern, and the Kahala--but I ultimately decided on the Royal Hawaiian for its charm, history, lush grounds, and its perfect position on Waikiki Beach.  We were not disappointed.Since we would be there for a week, we definitely wanted a room that would have space for relaxing as well as sleeping.  I chose the \u201cHistoric Junior Suite Garden View\u201d after looking at lots of photos online; a beach view would have been nice, but the modern Mailani Tower did not appeal to me as much as the historic wing, and ultimately square footage trumped view.Due to a delay in our flight, we did not end up checking in until almost 2:00 a.m.  When our driver pulled up to the hotel, there was a bellman at the desk, but he immediately took off, leaving us to deal with our luggage ourselves.  The torches were already snuffed for the night, and no one presented us with a welcome lei.  It was a disappointing way to arrive.At the front desk, we were warmly greeting by a clerk who was doing some paperwork.  She got us checked in quickly, and we found our way to our third floor junior suite.  I was immediately impressed by the enormous fresh flower arrangements throughout the hotel, the beautiful d\u00e9cor, and the pristine condition of the carpets and furnishings (some previous reviews noted signs of wear, but I didn\u2019t discern any myself).Our junior suite looked exactly like the photos online\u2014in fact, we discovered it is the same one they use in the hotel\u2019s promotional materials.  It really is a true suite rather than a junior suite, as it does have doors separating the bedroom from the living room that can be closed off for privacy.  Both the bedroom and living room were spacious, and the living room had large windows on two sides, making it feel almost like a sunroom or terrace when the drapes were open.  (We were able to leave the windows wide open at night to listen to the sounds of the birds and the rustle of the wind through the leaves\u2014no bugs!)  It was the best example of a true \u201cgarden view\u201d I have stayed in: like being in a luxurious treehouse suspended in the jungle!There was a large walk-in closet that easily accommodated all of our clothing and luggage, but the bathroom was postage-stamp tiny (no bigger than the closet, really).  Storage was a challenge here. The carpet in the room had been recently replaced (it was different from what is in the photos on the website), and everything about the room was pristine.  There was a wet bar in the living room with an empty refrigerator for convenient storage (oddly, no mini-bar items for purchase), and televisions in both rooms. We loved that the d\u00e9cor paid homage to the hotel\u2019s history and the Hawaiian aesthetic.As other reviewers have complained, we did not have bathrobes in our room, so I called down to the front desk and two were brought up (along with extra hangers, as we are chronic over-packers) in less than 5 minutes.  There were slippers in the closet, and lots of \u201cMalie\u201d brand toiletries and amenities in the bathroom.  I had a large floral arrangement sent from Watanabe Floral to celebrate our anniversary, and it was waiting for us on the dresser (it was exquisite).  There was also a bottle of the hotel\u2019s signature sparkling ros\u00e9 in the refrigerator, compliments of the manager.We slept very well in the exceedingly comfortable king sized bed with its down duvet, feather pillows, and Frette sheets.  (In fact, the signature pink striped robes and plush towels were Frette as well.)  It was one of the best hotel bed experiences I have enjoyed anywhere.  The only shortcoming in this regard was the inconsistency of turndown service.  It was not offered on our first night, so I called Housekeeping the next night to request it when we left for dinner:  the bed was turned down, chocolates, water, and a postcard were left on the nightstand, the drapes were closed and the used towels replaced.  The next night we did not have any service again, so I called each night for the remainder of our stay\u2014this should not be the guests\u2019 responsibility.   At a Luxury Collection hotel, I expect turndown service automatically, not by request.Our room rate included daily breakfast at Surf Lanai.  We were also given a coupon to use at the bakery for any three items from the pastries case: muffins, scones, or banana bread.  This seemed a little \u2018tacky\u2019 and not befitting a Luxury Collection hotel.  Instead, a loaf of the signature banana bread, left in the room with plates and knives, would have been a more elegant gesture.Coupons or tickets also had to be used for breakfast each morning.  I have never had to do this at any other luxury hotel where I have stayed with a breakfast-inclusive rate.  Twice during our stay I had to return to our room because I had forgotten to bring the tickets.  Very inconvenient, and again not befitting a Luxury Collection hotel.Other than the tickets nuisance, breakfast each morning was a delight, but occasionally we had to wait for up to 20 minutes for a table.  There was a small but adequate buffet that featured fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, eggs, bacon, sausages, breakfast sandwiches, cereals, pancakes, French toast, waffles, etc.  Additionally, we could order one breakfast entr\u00e9e from the menu.  I had the Pink Palace Pancakes three times (delicious), an omelet once, and just the buffet the rest of the time.  My partner enjoyed the crab omelet, the works omelet, and the eggs benedict throughout the week.  Coffee was good and replenished frequently, and there were always three or four freshly squeezed juices to choose from (I enjoyed the guava the best).  Service was friendly and efficient.  The only problem was the nuisance caused by the aggressive birds that dive-bomb unattended plates for food.  Some days they were worse than others. It was disconcerting to see them walking all over tables that had already been set, or taking food from plates that had not yet been cleared.On our first night, we had dinner at Azure, and it was fantastic.  The chilled seafood tower, while pricey, was exactly what we were craving.  Cocktails were well made, service was perfect, and an added bonus is that we had a perfect vantage point from which to witness the most spectacular fireworks display I have ever seen: the Nagaoka Fireworks display that capped off the weeklong Honolulu Cultural Festival.  It was a memorable night.During our week we rented beach chairs on three days (so convenient, and reasonably priced by Hawaii standards): twice on the RH property so we could enjoy food and beverage service, and once in the \u201cbrown chairs\u201d for front-row views of the ocean.  We did have a pool cabana booked for our last day, but when I saw how laughably small the pool is (I have never seen a smaller pool at a hotel of this size), we canceled it.  Guests do have access to the Sheraton pool next door, but it is a magnet for families with young children, and the resort does not have the same elegant atmosphere as the Royal Hawaiian.We used the small but well-equipped gym daily, joined the complimentary yoga classes in the garden twice, took part in the historical tour of the hotel and grounds, and participated in the sunrise \u201cHiu Wai Cleansing\u201d ceremony on the beach (a beautiful moment\u2014highly recommended).  We also attended the Aha\u2019Aina dinner and show, which due to threatening weather had to be held indoors; the food and drinks were okay, but the show was fantastic.   And we had a few of the killer mai tais at the Mai Tai Bar by the beach\u2014wow, they certainly pack a punch!  We also enjoyed browsing and shopping at the several interesting boutiques on-site.We had planned to do several excursions during our stay, but once we discovered how much we liked the resort, we really did not want to spend too much time off-grounds.  It is the kind of place that becomes more comfortable and even more enchanting the longer you stay there.I had almost cancelled our reservations due to some critical reviews I had read here in the weeks leading up to our stay, but I am so glad I did not.  Any concerns I had about service, condition of the hotel and the rooms, and the concierge service were dispelled within hours of arriving.  It truly is an oasis of luxury and serenity amidst the sea of humanity that is Waikiki.  No other hotel in the area has a better location and more extensive and lushly landscaped grounds.  We breathed a sigh of contentment each time we returned to the property from having been out elsewhere dining, shopping, or exploring. We would return to Honolulu again just to stay at the Royal Hawaiian."

For the prices of the rooms you can get a much nicer room at a three or four star hotel in a much more convenient location.  As for the location downtown is mostly deserted on weekends and you will have to travel several blocks for nightlife, dining and entertainment."

        "review_text": "This place is overrated.The staffs were rude. On my last day, April 2, 2017, the hotel had a blackout for about three hours. None of the staffs said sorry for the inconvenience.Then when I went back to my room, the toilet light couldn't work, found a used cigarette butt on top of the sink, and found a ripped plastic inside the toilet bowl. When I told the receptionist, no one said sorry and not even bother to give an explanation. They just sent the cleaning service to clean the toilet and an engineer to fix the lights. But both don't even said sorry or even a thank you after they were done.When we said thank you they were just rudely left out the room without looking back.The noise from the AC and the roads also unbearable.I was so disappointed because of this experience."

        "review_text": "It's a beautiful facility but it's not worth the money.  We stayed there for two nights in February.  The location is good but the room was dirty and there were roaches in the bathroom.  Room service was slow, expensive and very average tasting.  I would've rated it three stars if it weren't so expensive but people expecting quality are going to be disappointed."

        "review_text": "My wife and I debated for months before deciding to attend a cousin's wedding at the Trump hotel in D.C. due to the cost of flights and the cost of the room.  After making the point that neither of us would likely be staying there in the future due to the high cost, we both decided to spend the money for this one, exciting trip.  Upon arrival, we exited the shuttle car on the wrong side of the hotel.  The only entrance is on 11th street, and our driver was unfamiliar with the area.  As we walked around the building, we came upon tourist after tourist taking pictures near the newly renovated building that used to be the Old Post Office.  We found the entrance bathed in tourists soaking up the upcoming inauguration of Mr. Trump.  Fortunately, a white-gloved doorman forged his way through the throngs of people to grab our bags and whisk up the stairs and into the lobby.  He asked for my name, ensuring that I was referred to only as \"Mr. Horn\" for the rest of our stay.  The lovely lady at the desk not only found our reservation with speed, but also offered us water while a bell man arrived to get our bags.  She also was able to break some cash for me so that I could offer a tip to the men helping.  The bell man knew our room from top to bottom, instructing us on everything from the espresso machine to the automated curtains that hung over the window that reached nearly twenty feet tall.  Everything from the lobby to the room was extravagant.  The stairs and elevators retained the feel of the Old Post Office while the lobby screamed new and luxurious.  The bathtub could have easily held three of my wife, and the separate shower had a great shower head and a free-hanging wand.  For business travelers or anyone travelling for an event, a shoe shining service was complimentary and our room offered a steamer to help remove wrinkles in our clothes due to the rigors of travel.  The wedding in the Presidential Ballroom was amazingly decorated and was staffed by polite and experienced personnel that made sure that we had everything that we wanted.  When we left the following day, we really felt that our opinions on whether or not it was \"worth\" spending the money had been incorrectly formulated.  It will be worth it, from time to time, to spend the money and enjoy the first class service and surroundings that few besides Mr. Trump can provide."

The staff was super friendly and the place was just full of interesting art that was mind-boggling how these artists came up with these innovative ideas!Rooms were comfortable and well appointed. Lobby was so much fun with the unique style of decor and art.They have a wine hour with a bar centrally located in the lobby that is complementary. We did not take advantage of that because are so many bars that we wanted to try out in the area. But nice perk!The hotel management brought up a bottle of wine for my birthday. They were also very accommodating in every wayIt is centrally located just south of market, near a big shopping center with Nordstrom. Also just a few blocks from Union Square which was very convenient for usVery special place, that I would like to come back to in the future"

        "review_text": "I was booked here for a conference, not by choice. The building is exquisite, which of course has nothing to do with Trump. That is truly the only good thing I can say about this place. I arrived at 3:30, was told my room wasn\u2019t ready by a super unpleasant front desk clerk.  My room wasn\u2019t ready until 5:15.  I barely had time to take my bag to my room and get out the door for a 6pm appointment. I waited in the lobby while waiting for my room, and watched many other clients being told the same thing. I wish I\u2019d just left. When I got back to my room from dinner, I took a hard look around and noticed that the room wasn\u2019t terribly clean. There were no drinking glasses in the bathroom, the tub definitely hadn\u2019t been cleaned, no extra pillow.  I called down for drinking glasses and an extra pillow, was told I would have them immediately, I guess immediately now means 2 hours.  Staying here was a HUGE mistake.  Glad it was for only one night.  Normally, I\u2019ll leave my bag at the hotel and pick it up at the end of the day if attending a brief conference or meeting,but, honestly, after the service I received I was pretty much convinced that I\u2019d never see my bag again, so I took it with me.  Glad to be out of that tacky, overpriced, unpleasant place anyway."

        "review_text": "The Hilton is situated one block back from Waikiki Beach which limits the vista from the sea-facing rooms.  Having said that, the room rates are more affordable than beachfront properities.  The benefit of the locaiton is immediate access to the Honolulu transit busses as well as the independent operators.We found our room spacious, quiet and comfortable.  The bathroom was excellent, particularly the shower which was powerful and spacious.I was irritated with the pay-WiFi, something that is really unaccepable in this day and age.  $3.95 per day can be easily integrated into the room rate, so why make this an extra?  However, the service was fast enough for our needs, although the constant daily routine of having to re-validate and log in is an unescessary chore.The 42\" flat-screen TV is well above average, and includes the majority of HD chanels we desired.The air-conditioning is top-notch - almost totally silent and very efficient.We heard little noise from other rooms or corridor.An outside pool is located on the 10th floor of one of the hotel blocks, and we enjoyed this together with the hot-tub after a day of discovering the region.We were particularly impressed with the full breakfast served either on a bar setting or dining room.  The Eggs Bennie was top-notch.  Coffee was well above average and plentiful.Like many visitors, a visit to Pearl Harbor was high on our agenda.  Top tip:  Use the transit (#22).  For a $5 day-pass you'll be taken all the way to the visitor center.  The only disadvantage is it takes a little longer than using a taxi.  The $50 saving though makes it very attractiive.We would recommend the Hilton."

        "review_text": "This place has a ton of character, and its location is superb. I stay here every time I'm in town. A few tips: Pay the price for a waterside room with a balcony, it's all worth it at sunset and when you wake up. Utilize the beautiful lobby instead of cramming into the bar. Just get your drinks at the bar and walk over to the couches and comfortable chairs in the lobby, right by the massive windows looking over the Sound. When not carrying luggage, use the stairs. The hotel is only 4 stories and the long corridors are served rather slowly by one elevator. Don't pay for expensive Evian bottles in the room, the tap water is truly delicious. Don't even bother buying water at a convenience store. Seattle has great tap water, the very best of which flows freely and for free at the Edgewater. BYOB, the refrigerators have plenty of room for your own goods and I don't believe they are stocked with alcohol anyway. Get a waterside room!"

        "review_text": "The hotel is nice enough and still feels like a Westin even though it has changed names. It\u2019s still part of the SPG Family and the hotel is centrally located and near a BART/MUNI stop and feels very comfortable. However, unlike other SPG (Starwood) branded hotels that charge an add-on facility or \u201cresort fee\u201d and display that upfront on the main page of the hotel and throughout the booking process, this hotel sneaks it in on the last page of the booking confirmation listed among the required city/state/local taxes and fees even though the $25 per day \u201cFacility Fee\u201d goes directly to the hotel and is NOT a required tax item. I don\u2019t scrutinize the required taxes and fees in the confirmation because I figured they are all taxes and are applied equally by any hotel I would stay at that weekend. Until now, an SPG hotel hasn\u2019t tried to slide in additional fees either.For a hotel that has barely any amenities to begin with I asked - What does that facility fee cover? According to the hotel, the facility fee is for the following: in-room high speed internet, newspapers, Starbucks coffee both in our restaurant and guestrooms, unlimited local and 1-800 calls, in-room bottled water, luggage storage, fitness center access, and discounts for various activities as given by the concierge.I thought internet was free for anyone who booked on the SPG.com website or through the app? (It is according to their website). As a platinum member I receive the rest of the items for free at all times because of my status BUT at this particular I have to pay an extra $25 PER DAY for that privilege?Park Central \u2013 Either list the $25 per day fee on your website in several locations IN ADDITION to slipping it in at the booking confirmation stage or just add it into the nightly room rate so everyone can compare the real cost of staying at this hotel along with the others in the area when deciding how much to spend and where to stay when in town.Plain and simple \u2013 I consider this is a very deceptive practice!"

I mentioned my boyfriend's birthday at check-in and was given a bottle of wine on the spot.  I booked a normal king bedroom, but they gave me a corner room which was huge and included a couch.  They even had a surprise bottle of wine waiting for us!I had drinks and apps at the bar downstairs and both were very good.  After the wine event, we had friends over for drinks and ordered a pizza and everyone commented on how spacious our room was.  It was bigger or as big as some of their studio apartments.  The decor is super modern yet comfortable.In the morning, we grabbed a bottle of champagne across the street at the liquor store and made mimosas and watched tv in bed.  I do recommend bringing your own alcohol thought since the liquor store was overpriced.I did not want to leave the hotel because it was so comfortable.  It felt like my own swanky apartment.

It\u2019s closely located to the subway station, too. They had a good breakfast and changed some of the menu items from day to day, aside from eggs, fruits, and breads. Customer service is good. Kudos to the cleaning staff for keeping the room clean and tidy. IT support is also the best and immediately responded to internet problems. WIFI is fast. Room size was not an issue for us, as the bed was comfortable and soft."

A friend of mine booked a room and asked me if I wanted to venture to DC for the weekend.  I took her up on the offer thinking it would be great.  Boy was I wrong.  The building itself is beautiful but there is a cheapness in the decor that doesn't bode well with the price one pays.  The service was spotty and a bit slow.  I recommend elsewhere."

I was in SF for 4 nights on business and the hotel didn't put a foot wrong.After a warm and friendly welcome, my initial room was facing into the main road so I asked to move to a quieter room and was personally shown 2 alternatives for me to choose from. As I'm more interested in sleep than views I went for a room looking over air con units and a back street and it was perfect. Lots of space, everything worked flawlessly, quiet and comfortable.The bar was perfectly fine, with a few decent beers and good meals, and the games area helped while away a few hours.Perfectly positioned and a calm escape from the chaos outside the front door, this is high on my list of hotels to return to."

        "review_text": "We obtained a week at the Jockey Club by trading our bonus week.  Because of this, I wasn't expecting a 5 star resort. What we received was a 3 1/2 * resort with a 5 star location (If you get a view room).  As stated in other reviews, this resort is surrounded by the Cosmopolitan and Bellagio Hotels and you, in fact, can park in the Cosmopolitans underground parking structure in a section reserved for the Jockey Club guests on the 3rd level. This is where you start feeling the Cosmo does not want anybody to know there is a relationship with the Jockey Club. There are no directing signs to lead you to the JockeyClubs entrance until you are almost upon it. If you decide to self park, the entrance is on Harmon ave.  When you enter the Cosmo, stay in the 2nd lane from the right.  This will take you to the down ramp to the 3rd level (keep making quick lefts until the 3rd level is reached).  Once on the 3rd level take the 3rd left (you'll see a 5mph sign) and go straightuntil you see the Jockey Club signs.  You can take the elevator to JC1 which will drop youoff in an empty parking area. Look to your right where the gift shop is and you can take a shortcut through there to the front desk.You use these same elevators to get direct access to the Cosmopolitan casino area.  Ifyou do, be sure to memorize nearby landmarks because on your way back, there are nosigns telling you the Jockey Club even exists.One of the benefits of the Jockey Club is that you can use the Cosmo pool area. To get there, use the aforementioned elevators and enter the casino. Make a left at the Book and Stage lounge and follow the path to the left of the escalators. Make another left at the restrooms sign ahead and follow the path to the elevators. Take the elevator to the 4thfloor and you are within 20 feet of the pool entrance.  Just show your room key toenter and grab some towels.Now, to review the hotel itself.  The rooms are dated with a somewhat low end feeling to them. However, we found everything clean and comfortable.  The bed was firm and the room was quiet. One thing unusual for a timeshare is that there was a daily tidy service which was very helpful.In conclusion, in a place like Las Vegas, where you don't spend much time in your room,the Jockey Club is a welcoming spot to stay even if its 5 star neighbors refuse to believe it exists."

        "review_text": "My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Waikiki Beach the week of Dec 11. This was our first time visiting beautiful Hawaii and this hotel was a perfect fit for our vacation.We chose this hotel because of the very reasonable room rate (there are no daily service charges like the other hotels) and it's central location. The hotel is new, clean, modern and never seemed busy or over crowded. Also, the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, no issues here whatsoever.We stayed in a guest room with one king bed and a lanai on the 17th floor. We had lovely views of the mountains. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows options to choose from. Couldn't hear a sound from our neighbours or traffic in the hallway. A Keurig coffee machine with an assortment of k-cups, a microwave and fridge were included in the room.Kona coffee is available in the lobby for hotel guests from 6 a.m. each morning and cold pineapple water is available in the afternoon.A self-serve laundry is located on the 3rd floor and a 24 hour laundry mat is across the street. HoloHolo Market (closes at midnight) and TR Fire grill are connected to the hotel.There is valet parking only for $35 per day. We found most guests hiring a car at the hotel for a day to avoid the fee.The beautiful International Market Place is directly across the street. It's brand new with high street shops and restaurants. You can walk to Waikiki beach by walking through the mall which is about a 5-7 min walk.Marukame Udon is a block away from the hotel. We visited this popular noodle house in the morning for breakfast to avoid waiting in long lines.The Food Pantry is across the street which is uber convenient.The number 8 bus to Ala Moana Mall is right outside the door (it's a 15-20 min drive). The bus fair is $2.50 pp.I highly recommend booking Charlie's Taxi service airport transfers in advance for a flat rate of $29 each way. it's about a 25 - 45 min drive to the hotel. You will say about $15-20.Overall, the hotel was very nice and in a very good location. We highly recommend staying here."

Because we booked through Smith Hotels, we got a free bottle of local wine and they let us choose between red and white. It was great! The lobby is beautiful but fun with a lively bar and plenty of sitting room. We enjoyed spending time there. The \"playroom\" on the second floor is great! It has pool, shuffleboard, board games, and several tv's where we watched Warriors games with fellow fans. Our room, a Deluxe King, was incredibly spacious. The standing writing desk was large and the espresso machine was nice. There was a mini fridge and though we didn't use it except for storing our own drinks, the prices were quite reasonable! The bed was comfy and the art on the wall (classic rock albums) was awesome!One of the best things about the hotel was the staff! They were always friendly and we even met one woman who graduated from our alma mater! After we had our \"Auburn moment\" with her, she helped us get a great rate on a rental car to explore Muir Woods and Sausalito for the day. When we returned, we had two local beers and a kind note from her in our room. This was so touching and we really appreciate it (thank you Rachael!)!!The restaurant, The Cavalier, was fantastic for Sunday brunch before we headed to a Giants game. Friendly service and GREAT FOOD! We even got a free dessert bc it was our anniversary!All in all, Zetta was a PERFECT home base for our SF adventures. We would certainly return!"

        "review_text": "Beware of dark areas in parking lot or strangers calling out to you. We were mugged on our first night there, with a gun being put to my daughter, demanding cash or the car.  After talking to some other businesses in the same area, 2 days later the gas station was held up as well, found out that the weekly stay place next to the Tahiti village is housing undesirable people, such as drug dealers.In terms of the resort itself, it looked great, but it was too cold and windy for us to use any of the outside facilities. And lets face it, after you get held up at gunpoint your first night there, it sort of ruins the rest of the week for you. There is a lovely pool, hot tub, barbeque area, all of which we did not use.  There is a gym (small), spa (smelled lovely every time we got off the elevator- but did not use), and a room on the 10th floor with outside patio area with a lovely view of the entire strip.Our room had a Jacuzzi tub and a steam shower (which we used each day). Beds were comfortable.  Our view was to an empty lot and the parkade for the airport car rental place.  Not a very nice view. But it was too cold and windy to really stay on the balcony anyways.Our 2 bedroom suite was great! We had two adjoining 1 bedroom suites was more than plenty big enough for the 5 of us.  We were in the bag building, can not remember the name of it.  Kitchen was well equipped. We were there for 5 days, and even paid a fee for housekeeping, but did not see any housekeeping ourselves.  Had to call down for fresh towels on day 4 and for more coffee. Should not have to pay a fee, if we do not get housekeeping. We had used our timeshare points to trade into Tahiti Village.I would have rated the resort hire if there was not a safety factor.  The parking lot is open to anyone that wants to walk or drive through it.  There is also a Dennys that neighbours the property and parking lot, so that brings more people into the area.  If there was better lighting and more security patrolling the parking lot, it would make a difference.  But what I think they need to do is securely fence off the entire resort to all other traffic and people, making it only accessible to guests of the resort.We unfortunately will never go back there again. Especially since all staff that worked there was not alerted that guests were being mugged at gunpoint. Our booking was not even flagged to alert staff, as was apparent by the young fella checking us out."

        "review_text": "AFTER YOU GET OFF THE PHONE ITS TOO LATE.I have not stayed at this resort and will not for the following reason.After booking numerous rooms in March 2015 with Holiday Inn Express to travel across the USA I was transferred to another person to discuss a great deal.  It was never mentioned this was a timeshare, it was implied the deal was due to the points being accumulated due to the numerous bookings for the cross country trip..  I agreed to the \" deal\" not knowing it was a timeshare or there being a sales presentation involved and would never agree to this. They billed my American Express right away.  I was not concerned until I attempted to make reservations for this deal in July and discovered it was a timeshare.  After emailing and making numerous phone calls I was repeatedly told by curt, short and extremely unhelpful people ( one even laughed and said a manager wouldn't help me) all repeating to me \" The phone calls are recorded\" and \" Its in writing ..no refunds\"   I sent one final email to \"Customer Care\" whom answered in one hour and 35 minutes \" No refunds its in writing\" I have asked several times for a copy of the original phone , a copy of what they sent me in writing and contact information for the legal department... of course... no answer to my request for this information, it has been ignored completely.  While I want my refund  this is about the principle and the deception, not the money.   I truly cannot believe how a Large corporation whom has been around for years simply does not appear to care.  There are other Trip Advisor reviews for Holiday Inn with the same complaint as mine.  It is very sad because the individual location experiences I  had were good and I would have used them again.  Consumers beware and individual Holiday Inn Express location  Management beware.  This is what is occurring when customers call the general reservation line to stay at your individual locations.  These scams are going to hurt your business and times are already tough."

        "review_text": "I received a call from a Bluegreen Resorts specialist sometime in October of 2016 letting me know that I \"won\" a vacation package for a 4 days and 3 nights stay from select cities in the US. They also mentioned that I will earn an extra dining gift card, a cruise and another 3 nights stay at another hotel if me and my significant other will attend a two hour sales pitch of their timeshare deal. Over the phone, they asked me to pay $298 to reserve my spot for this deal. I was like, \"OK, $298 for a 4 day, 3 night stay in one of their resorts is not too bad plus I get some free gifts after.\" Originally we planned to go to Orlando, FL but ended up using the \"free\" vacation in Las Vegas. Before our trip, I checked out the BG resort which is called Club 36 and saw some decent pictures of it on TripAdvisor thinking that this is where we will be staying. I even thought that they will put us in a nicer room or even a junior suite since they're trying to sell us their product right??? WRONG! When we arrived to BG resort in Vegas, they told us that we will be staying at the Tropicana hotel for the duration of our trip and never explained why we were staying there. I said, \"no big deal\" because the location of Club 36 was far from the strip anyways and we didn't rent a car. Well, we didn't know that staying at the Tropicana was gonna cost us another $100 (resort fees) for 3 nights. Tropicana gave us a room alright, they put us on a corner room very far from the elevator in the Club tower which is about a 10 minute walk from our room to the main hotel lobby. It felt like a joke!!! To add to my disappointment, this \"free\" vacation is not looking free at all anymore now that I checked Tropicana's room rates, it's $99 a night which if you do your math correctly totals $297!!! I coughed up $298 for this BS vacation! Btw, we still went to the timeshare sales pitch since we committed to it already and they kept us there for more than 3 hours!!! They said they would only keep us for 2. I didn't tell my boyfriend how much it ended up costing me for the trip because I know he will be very mad to find out he sat for a 3 hour sales pitch for nothing on Super Bowl Sunday. =/ We ended up not giving in to any of their *** and after reading other people's reviews on the \"free\" cruise and hotel stay, I don't think I should even do it at all since it's going to cost me a lot of money in the end anyway. PS. During our past Vegas trips, We've stayed at the Aria, PH, MGM, Palazzo and even at the Trump Hotel and gotten a lot of good deals just booking those hotels on our own without the timeshare bs. Those hotels/rooms were way better than the Tropicana AND we didn't have to waste 3 hours of our vacation!!!"

Even though I was able to get a room on Priceline for less than half the rack rate, I was disappointed. The gaudy new decor of the hotel has no respect for the historic architecture; it's so over the top that some may suspect it was done by Viktor Yanukovych's personal decorator. While everything in my room was grandiose; the atmosphere was oddly impersonal and antiseptic, thus not conducive to relaxation. Similarly, service was so overly fawning and scripted; I wondered if I was dealing with cyborgs.Washington DC has a number of authentically elegant classic hotels, including the Hay-Adams, Jefferson, and St. Regis. I'll stay at one of them on my next visit to DC."

        "review_text": "A place filled with cigarette smoke and BED BUGS! Stayed there for 3 nights in May 2017. The place is far away from the strip (30 min ride) and airport - almost 40 min ride - basically in the middle of nowhere. Lay out is terrible - 1/2 mile walk just to get to the elevators. Cigarette smoke felt everywhere and there were no room service for 3 nights stay. They charge a resort fee for a shallow cold pool that is closed on Friday and weekend nights (due to some events there). Spa is obviously extra. Worst of all - BED BUGS! Please see the picture."

        "review_text": "Spent a couple of days in San Francisco before heading south.  This hotel is in an excellent location just off tourist central about a clock from Market and Powell and the start of the Trolley.  If you are willing to walk it was in striking distance of the mission and the west side. However it is on the edge of the Tenderloin which can get pretty seedy at night.  This is a nice small boutique hotel.  The first room we were in was admittedly very small.  The room had a bad odor which we thought we could air out with the AC.  Problem was as soon as AC shut off room smelled greasy again.  We informed the front desk about an hour after our arrival.  It took about 15 minutes but they very graciously moved us to another room on another floor.  Definitely an upgrade.  Kudos to the front desk for so pleasantly taking care of their guests.  We will return"

        "review_text": "Having never been to San Francisco before, and only consulting with a few people who had been before me, I found myself at the mercy once again of travel sites to help guide me in my search for a hotel in San Francisco.  There was also the age old question to answer, which was, \u201cwhere in San Francisco should I stay??\u201d  The two choices were abundantly clear, staying near the famous Wharf area or staying in the Union Square area.  Ultimately, we chose to stay in the Union Square area, but I\u2019ll go into my decision making process later in the review, as no doubt, this was the single most paralyzing decision when making travel plans for San Fran.My other two requirements, which believe it or not, were pretty tough to find, was that the kids needed to have a pool, so they could decompress later in the day before dinner and us as parents needed a fridge in the room, so we could keep our drinks cold and not have to rely on icing them down every night.  As I mentioned before, we also settled on the Union Square area, so more on that below.  In terms of search results, the Handlery Union Square hotel popped up and looked interesting.  First thing to note, is that the hotel is an independently owned hotel, owned by a Mr. Handlery.  So it\u2019s not part of a mega chain, not a Marriott, Hyatt, etc.  This sort of intrigued me, but also frightened me.  Ultimately, I made the choice to stay here.  Let me dive in to my experience.Location:If you decide on staying in the Union Square area, this hotel is literally on the next block over from Union Square, on Geary Street.  You can see Union Square plain as day when you walk out of the front of the hotel.  From this location you have easy access to Powell Street, which is a half a block down.  You can pick up the cable car from the corner, or walk down two blocks to where the Powell Street Cable Car line actually begins.  Near this location, you have unlimited options for restaurants, breakfast spots, drug stores, (Walgreens, CVS, etc), Macy\u2019s, and the huge Westfields mall.  You\u2019re also a stone\u2019s throw from Market Street, which is San Francisco\u2019s main thoroughfare, that leads you right down to the famous clock tower and ferry terminal buildings.  We walked this one day on our way to the Exploratorium, and if you\u2019re in moderate to good health, it\u2019s certainly walkable, if not, the Muni system is easy to navigate as well.  In a nutshell, the Handlery Union Square Hotel\u2019s location is hard to beat.Check In:Check in took less than a minute.  Granted, we arrived well after checkout, around 4pm the day after Christmas, so there was very little activity in the lobby area.  Staff seemed friendly and got us through the process very quickly.  It turns out that this hotel has a few \u201czones.\u201d  There\u2019s a \u201chistoric\u201d section and a \u201cpremier\u201d section.  We were given a room in the premier section, so unfortunately, I cannot describe the historic section for the purpose of this review.  Our room was on the sixth floor of the premier section, and I will say, initially, navigating to the elevators in this section is a bit confusing, as you have to go up some steps, past the pool area, then to the elevator bank.  If you have large & heavy bags, this can be challenging.  Once we were settled, however, I sort of like this section, because if you took the elevator down to the ground floor, you had easy access out the back of the hotel, which brought you that much closer to Powell Street, the cable car, shops, etc.  So essentially the hotel faces both ends of the block.  Interesting enough, the pool area also has rooms that surround it, kind of like those old motels you see in Florida and in LA, so that\u2019s was interesting.  Just so you know, if you get one of the pool area rooms, the pool opens at 8am.  My kids were out there one day right at 8am, and even though I told them to be respectful, it\u2019s tough to stay quiet while playing in a pool.  If you like to sleep in, avoid these rooms.The Room:First impression of the room was favorable.  We are all the way down at the end of the hall on the sixth floor facing south, and facing O\u2019Farrell Street, being able to see right down Cyrill Magnin Street, which leads right to the mall.  I thought the road noise might be a problem, but this was not the case.  The room had two large double beds, a desk area, a desk chair, a sitting chair, and a dresser area with a flat screen TV on it.  The bathroom had a dressing area / makeup area, then the toilet, sink, & tub through the door.  The room felt spacious for two adults and two kids and was very comfortable.  I noticed a few minor issues with some areas of paint flaking on the ceiling, but that was me just nitpicking.  I would pick the room all over again if given the chance.  At night, the room remained dark and we could not hear any street noise that affected our ability to sleep comfortably.  Lastly, the room did have a small dormitory style fridge, which was good enough to hold a six pack of beer, waters, and other small drinks.  There is a soda machine and an ice machine down at the end of the hall next to the elevators.The Pool:The pool is heated and is like having an Oasis in the middle of San Francisco.  The kids loved it and the desired effect of allowing the kids to decompress after a day of sightseeing was met.  The water is warm, the pool is kept clean, and the only downer is that the heat lamps in the pool area didn\u2019t seem to be working.  However, this wasn\u2019t a problem for us.  The only problem was getting out of the pool and experiencing a chill before getting into the hotel, since the pool is outdoors and it is December, after all.The Staff:For the most part, everyone we encountered on the staff were friendly.  Check in staff was friendly, the housekeeping staff was friendly and respectful, and the concierge was super friendly, even though we didn\u2019t really use him.  There were a couple of mornings we got up early to go out and have breakfast, where we walked past the front desk without a \u201chello\u201d or a \u201cgood morning,\u201d but again, I\u2019m being nit picky here.  I would rate the staff highly just from other interactions and their willingness to help us, even though we didn\u2019t really need it.Food:I don\u2019t believe the hotel has its own restaurant, but it is quite literally attached to the Daily Grill which is right next door and there is an internal walkway to get into the restaurant.  We dined here the first night and I must say, the food was very good.  Look for my review of the Daily Grill if you \u2018re interested in learning more.Transport:We didn't have a car, but the hotel does have a garage.  We used Uber to and from SFO and public transport to get everywhere else.Negatives:No place is perfect right?  I wouldn\u2019t cite anything at this hotel as being a real negative.  I\u2019m going to be nit picky on a few things, just because there are things to consider.  The hotel is a bit like a maze, especially if you get a room in the executive area.  However, once you realize this and figure it out, it\u2019s easy.  As I mentioned, you also have access to exiting the hotel from the south.So, I said I would explain why I chose to stay in Union Square over staying near the Wharf area.  Perhaps this will help you make your decision if you\u2019re struggling as I was.  It comes down to a few pretty simple things.  I chose Union Square because I thought that given all the activities we were going to do, that being centrally located would be the right call.  The Union Square area is a bit more urban and if you prefer the city life, shopping, dining in non-chain style restaurants & diners, & more choices regarding the muni transit system, then I would choose Union Square.  If you\u2019re into being close to the water, chain restaurants, touristy focused shops and restaurants, but also want great views of the Golden Gate bridge or the Bay Bridge, plan to go to Sausalito or Muir Woods, then staying down on the Wharf or even the Embarcadero sections would probably be the call to make.  If I ever go back to San Fran, since I\u2019ve already done Union Square, I\u2019d probably choose the Wharf area the next time around.Final thoughts:There are a lot of hotel choices in the area and the price differences aren\u2019t that large.  It all comes down to what\u2019s your preference.  We noticed a lot of great hotels walking around, but while they were beautiful, they didn\u2019t meet our criteria.  In the end, the Handlery Hotel was a fine choice for us and I would have no problem recommending it to anybody.A few words of advice:The one thing I was not prepared for in considering my visit to San Francisco was the amount of homeless people I would see.  It was literally quite shocking.  The first night while walking around, we probably walked into an area that we should have and it felt a bit unsafe.  During that walk, we witnessed rampant drug use, public urination, and nudity.  Thankfully, it appeared that my 8yr old kids were oblivious, but it became a teaching moment to our children about life and how some people are less fortunate than others due to circumstances, choices, drug use, & mental health issues.  After the initial shock of the quantity, I became used to what I saw, but seeing homeless men in wheelchairs without shoes in the winter, women with infants on the streets, young men and women on the streets doing drugs, it was painful in some instances to see this.  The Wharf area has it\u2019s share of homeless too, but it was more rampant in the Union Square area.  Nobody bothered us, but it is something to consider when making your travel arrangements.  Avoid the Tenderloin area if you can."

        "review_text": "I cancelled reservations at a nearby hotel to stay at MADE. I wanted to make my mom's birthday weekend extra special. BIG mistake.Cleanliness is my deal breaker, so let's start there:CLEANLINESS1. Toenail in the sheets of a newly made-up room. Suggests that they did not change the sheets.2. Trash behind the curtains of a newly made-up room.3. Our elevator stopped on a floor, where we overheard housekeeping supervisor instruct: \"Don't change the sheets, or you'll have to change them all.\" Another guest in the elevator turned to us. He said, \"Yes. You heard that right.\" And sighed.QUALITYPretty on the surface. But poorly made.1. I reserved 2 rooms. In both, the toilet paper holder flipped vertically (so the roll fell off). It wasn't installed correctly.2. In the balcony room, the balcony door would not lock. Safety issue here. (a) There was an adjoining balcony with access; (b) There was a child staying in the room. Front desk insisted that it worked, \"You just needed to pull the door with your weight before closing it.\" That explains why the handle was detached from the door. When moved to another room, the handle was also detached from the balcony door. Again, we were told, \"It's supposed to be that way.\"3. The pretty wall sconce was installed in a hole punched in the wall which had not been patched.4. In one room, clock radio did not work.5. In one room, light did not work. (It flickered.)6. In one room, the shower did not drain, leaving us to stand in 1-2 in of water.QUIETWhen I made the reservation, I requested: Please put us in a quiet room. I followed up 1 week before arrival to confirm: \u201cAre we in a quiet room?\u201dInstead, we were placed in a room next to the elevator on a high floor (12). (The music from rooftop bar goes down the elevator shaft.) Front desk said -- \u201cWe only get sound complaints on the higher floors, 12 and up.\u201d Knowing that, why did MADE put us in that room?VALUEWe upgraded one room to balcony -- but it was a waste. There is NO seating on the balcony. (Front desk told us to drag luggage benches outside.) And, as noted, the doors were broken.What's more, the bathroom was so tiny, you have to sit sideways on the toilet.The prices dropped drastically during our stay. The front desk agreed to match the current rate. Then on checkout, I had to recalculate, as it was still incorrect. Just so exhausting!GENERALAs noted, this was a special occasion \u2014 my mom\u2019s birthday. When I made the reservation, I asked if I could PAY to have balloons in the room. The hotel offered, \"We'll take care of it!\" When I arrived, there were 3 balloons scotch-taped to the pipes on the wall. It looked sad.Advice to hotel: Don't say you'll take care of it, then give it D effort. I was willing to pay for this.TO SUM UPIf cleanliness, safety, and value matter, go elsewhere (Arlo NoMad, for one). At least until MADE works out its substantial growing pains. It is a lovely hotel on the surface. And the staff was responsive. But that matters little when problems keep popping up."

You\u2019ve managed to take the perfect layout of the old style rooms and completely ruin it3) You\u2019ve also managed to throw millions of \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s at a total redesign of the hotel interior and completely ruin the colours and the whole vibe, it now feels like a corporate office. Well done4) You\u2019ve taken away the big canopy from the diving area of the pool but that\u2019s ok as you\u2019ve also banned diving too.5) You\u2019ve decides instead to put up a canopy at premium leister to ruin the rises from outside instead.6) Fewer staff and looks like you\u2019ve decided to try and save money by not training them up to your previous standards7) 360 bar gone, Mahiki gone. We can no longer use the marina beach?8) Pretty much the only decent thing left is Wild Wadi and it\u2019s flowriders but now it seems like you are going to tear this down and make a \u201cbetter one\u201d. Let\u2019s hope you at least consult your guests this time rather than make a complete hash of it like you have done with all the other changes.9) Our only hope is that some bright spark will see the opportunity here and recreate the resort as it originally was 20 years ago far enough away from Dubai in somewhere like Fujairah or Oman"

I planned this Hotel for 2 nights before heading to Kaui (2n) and then Maui (4n).  Planned for my wife's Bday and Valentine's Day.We are a young married couple (low 30's, married 2 years).  What that means- we are fun.   :)Check in:We were welcomed by JUSTIN at check in (8pm).  Young, good looking, and Extremely nice and helpful!!!  A+++ for Justin.And I knew a lot about the area- but I wanted to double check my plans w the conceigere....and WOW- was Terry a bottle of positivity or what!!!!  So so so nice and helpful!!!  A++++, she gave us additional plans that were spot on!!!!Hotel fee: read the reviews. Stop complaining people!!  Every hotel charges them.  And guess what- I drove around the block for 30mins attempting to avoid the garage fee of $25- only to find out the parking for your stay is INCLUDED in your hotel fee.  HAHAH- what a deal!!!  Hotel fee also included a free 4x6 pic, drink voucher, Wi- FI, and a few other things.Rooms:I have read so many reviews before coming here that I just could not believe some people on here.  First off, we must have spent 7 hours each day in our rooms- to only sleep.  I have stayed in 100's of hotel rooms for work and OKAY this isn't my favorite room, but it still had EXACTLY what we needed.  And the balcony made the room a complete success.  A+ room.To do:Eat: Duke's.  Great atmosphere on the water.  Good crowd. Enter through a hotel.ABSOLUTE BEST food your money- RAINBOWS!!  Get the loco moto.  We went there a second time for lunch and I ordered the mixed plate.  $7.75 and $8.00 respectively.  Opposed to my 2 tacos at Dukes for $18.75.- Pearl Harbor is a must!  Opens at 7am.  Get there earlier and grab your tickets before the allotted tickets for the assigned time slot run out.- Hike Diamond Head!  Another must.  0.8 hike. It was not that hard- anyone can do it.  Wear sneakers!- bc I see so many people wear sandals.  Ugh.  :).   $1/person fee. Or $5/car.  And at the bottom get the shaved ice for $3.25.-Go to the North Shore.  Along the different beaches We explored Waimea Bay (beach there). We also went over to the Waimea Park and went to the waterfall for a $16 fee.  Bring a waterproof disposable camera for the waterfall.- along the drive was THE Dole main station. We stopped for a few minutes.  (Overpriced pineapple IMO).- we ate at Jameson's (before Waimea).That's all...I really hope that helps!"

The hotel is excellent and I could not fault it:- We requested, and were given, a great room on a high floor... The views over Dubai are unrivaled in my opinion.  What made out room extra special was the 'viewing window' which pointed out of the building and had a little ledge you could stand on and really take in the view.  The room itself was large, well designed and with great features.  I remember the bed being a little on the hard side, but no great issue.- Pool terrace, perfect with good views over Dubai and some nice food.  It might get a little crowded in the daytime but was very relaxed during the sunset chill time.- Gym - A good size with modern equipment, no complaints.- Breakfast - A vast combination of high quality food.  A special commendation should go to the Oriental lady who hosted breakfast, she remembered my smoothie order every morning and went out of her way to give us an extra special experience, probably some of the best service I have ever experienced.- Indian restaurant; apparently the best curry house in Dubai and it really shows, some of the food we had was out of this world, and with generous portions.- Terrace on Level 42, must be the best view in Dubai, especially how it looks onto the Burj Khalifa, worth an evening visit.I don't know when we will next be back there but the Shangri-La will be the first place I look up to stay at."

        "review_text": "We've stayed at the Kahala many times over the last five years. It was a luxury property worth the high prices. Since the new owners, their room rates have gone up and their service down. They need an adult pool. Their only pool was full of loud children. We love children!  But we could not hear each other. The service at the pool was non-existent. After 4 days of this, we did not want to spend our last 6 days dealing with substandard changes. We talked to the manager and explained why we were moving to the Royal Hawaiian and they still insisted on charging us $1000 early checkout fee!  Now we're paying half the cost and getting twice the service. We're not going back unless they bring back the old Kahala!"

Imagine what someone MIGHT have done with this location!The bad:  Front desk staff not at all welcoming.  There was a type of arrogance out of line with the pedigree of the hotel---this is not the Ritz, after all.  Given the tackiness of the interior, the arrogance was laughable.The ugly:  Well, the hotel itself.  My goodness, this place is tacky!What could be changed:  Overall cleanliness.  I realize this is a busy place, but housekeeping should be able to keep up.  The smell of whatever air freshener is being used is intense, but might not be necessary if the room were cleaner."

Later that evening I was told that the discounted rate was incorrect and that we would be charged a higher rate. The front desk then told me that due to the error we would also be moved to another room but was not given an explanation for the move. Front desk simply said that the Rooms Director ordered the move and that they were unable to give any further information. In the end, we moved into a \"city view\" room which did not offer any views except a view of a parking lot with a higher rate than our original ocean view room. To add to injury the hotel was not bustling and appeared to be low occupancy during our stay.No clear reason given for the room change. Very disappointed."

        "review_text": "So a couple of caveats to start the review.  I stayed at this property April 29th to May 4th, five nights using 240,000 Marriott Points.  As some of you may know, if you book five nights you pay for four nights and get the fifth night free. So even though it costs 60,000 points a night it actually breaks down to 48,000 points a night which is a bargain considering suites go from $500-$800 a night.The second caveat is that I was there to decompress after a death in the family two months ago and I just needed to get away.  I have previously been to Oahu and done all of the tourist things so the main purpose of this trip was to relax and have some good local food.I travel extensively though I have never stayed at Ritz Carlton property before.  After this trip it would be hard to stay anywhere else.So that being said, I will begin my review in my usual style of Pros and Cons:PROS1. The employees.  From Tomoko and Josh at the Front Desk, to Robin, Sequoia and Ocean at the pool to Wes in the bar, an outstanding group of individuals.  Not only are they always pleasant to the guests, their interaction with each other is unique as well.  Never have I been around so many friendly, wonderful outgoing individuals.2.  My Suite.  I was on the 22nd floor of the Diamond Tower which is the slightly newer of the two buildings.  Traveling by myself I had plenty of room and I could have easily brought two friends and we would all have been comfortable.  Two HD TV's, a super comfortable king bed, and separate small living area with a pull out sofa, a stunning bathroom with glass shower, soaking tub, dual sinks, and a bidet.3.  Also included in my suite was a washer/dryer which meant I was able to pack very light.  A refrigerator, microwave/oven, dishes, silverware etc, wine glasses; all top quality items. A Nespresso machine and coffee pods which were restocked every day.4.  The lanai was huge and the views of the water every day was pristine.5.  There are two pools, one for adults only.  There are only about 30 lounges but there was always one available.  There were two hot tubs anchoring the pools.6. A great fitness center with everything for a great workout (which I did daily).  All the equipment was new and in perfect working order.7. Approximate 10 minute walk to the beach through the park across the street.8. Even though you are in Waikiki it was very quiet at this hotel.Additional positives:At 3 pm each day they serve a (very) small cup of ice cream at the kids pool.  The flavor of the day is a locally made Hawaiian ice cream.From 3 pm-6 pm each day, cocktails, beer, wine, small bites and salads are half price at the pool.  For $8.00 you receive an excellent cocktail.High speed internet is free and available to all guests.NO RESORT FEEAdditionally, after you book this property you receive an email from customer service asking information about your arrival time and flight information.  When I advised them I would not be getting to the hotel until around 9 pm. I was advised they would put a snack in the refrigerator as I might be hungry.  That \"snack\" of fruit, cheese, chips, olives, meat and honey took me three days to finish.When you arrive to check in you get a refreshing tropical beverage.CONS:Just to nitpick only a couple.Strangely, there was no clock in my room.  I had to ask twice for one and once they provided it, it didn't glow so if the room was dark you had no idea what time it was.In the fitness center, in addition to every piece of cardio equipment having a TV, there are two large screen TV's for individuals lifting weights.  However, there was no remote control to change the channels.  After asking for a remote for a couple of days and not getting one, I would bring one of the two remotes from my suite which worked just fine.I believe valet parking was $40 a night.  I rented a car for one day $42 through Costco and parked on the Ala Wei Canal for free.  You really don't need a car in Waikiki and their public transportation system is wonderful $2.75 one way or $5.50 for an all day pass.  The transit system goes all over the island and to all the tourist destinations.I could do a whole separate review on restaurants, but if you need specifics email me and I will let you know.  I can tell you that I only ate in local places usually within two miles of the hotel for dirt cheap and wonderful food.In conclusion two things.  If you are a Marriott member, especially using points, this is hands down the best value on the island for the best service imaginable.  I saw the other properties and for a few points less I wouldn't waste my time.Second.  Even though it never has occurred to me to spend $500 a night at a hotel, I would do so at this property if I don't have enough points when I come back.  It was that remarkable.Cheers!Marius"

        "review_text": "Pay attention to your bill. This hotel is charging a resort fee and they are NOT a resort. This is what it pays for:Two (2) Reusable Water Bottles \u2014  two low-quality bottles one of which broke almost immediately.Beach Chairs \u2014 You have to get them from valet and carry them to the beach (about five blocks away) yourself.Local phone calls from the guest room up to 60 minutes per stay \u2014 No one does this anymore.Pool & Beach Towels \u2014 This pool is a joke I\u2019ve seen much bigger pools at airport hotels.Business Center Access \u2014 two computers in a hallway near the lobby that I never saw anyone use.24-hour Stay-Fit Gym Access \u2014 A very basic gym and not worth a fee.Daily Hawaiian Cultural Hour (available five days per week) \u2014 nobody mentioned this or knew about it.Complimentary Arrival Beverage \u2014 I was offered a plastic cup of pineapple juice while I waited for my room. \"Complimentary means FREE stupid!\"Discounted Beach Activities \u2014 this was never mentioned at check-in or check-out, so it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s included.What a resort fee is, is just a way to make you think you are paying one price when you compare to other hotels and you actually pay another price when you check out. If you compare apples to apples, this hotel is TOO HIGH! I now look for hotels that charge a fee and mark them off my list whether they are a good location or not. It is dishonest since you cannot opt out, the fee should just be part of the price. A fee is something for something. You do not get a value out of this, because it is charged every day and you only get the FREE drink once. They need to learn from the airlines and start including all charges in the price unless it is optional before someone sues them or the government regulates them. By the way, the end result is you think you are paying for five nights stay but the fee adds on enough to pay for a sixth day."

        "review_text": "It saddens me to write this review because my wife and I have loved this hotel for years.The location and views are still some of the best in San Francisco. However, the awesome hotel service, knowledge and friendly staff, amenities and charm has disappeared!  Really wanted this to not be the case and tried to over come this multiple times during our four day stay. As a Fairmont Presidents Club member, I want this property to continue its reign as a premier property in San Francisco, however those days appear to be long gone.A few key examples:Upon checking in and getting to the $1,250+ a night room, there was not a bottle of water to be found and when asking for one it was as if we asked for something very outside the norm. After traveling all day, how would they not place even two small bottles water by the bedside?Turndown service is bare. Property used to put one small Ghiradelli chocolate on the pillow because of the building it's housed in. Now nothing. No water, no chocolate, no amenities of any kind. Additionally, housekeeping just stacks towels on top of each other.  They don't place on towel racks or present the way normal luxury hotels do.Common areas don't get cleaned regularly. Beer bottles and smoked cigar butts were sitting out on the common area deck  tables from the night before until 3pm the next day. Come on!  I had a guest come up and visit me for a cup of coffee at 10am and it was too gross to sit outside of our room in the common area and talk because it was dirty from the night before from other guests. Additionally, the iconic outside fireplace that is in all the brochures of this property was never turned on and never worked. This fireplace used to run regularly and was iconic for this Fairmont property. Now it doesn't burn, which is a great symbolic connection in the fact that the sizzle and soul of this property is gone too.In the morning my wife needed a very basic hygiene item and when we called the front desk, they sent us to a liquor store across the street that was closed. The staff didn't state they could assist with getting this common hygiene item, know where to send us or frankly take any concern for trying to find a way to truly help us. In the past, the level of care the hotel had for its guests was one of the finest things about this Fairmont. Now, its as if they are all overwhelmed and under resourced.It's important to note that I did contact the hotel manager Mr. Nassir and leave a message with the front seaside that I wanted to speak with him, but he apparently wasn't in. Later I asked for the manager on duty and there was a very polite women that I spoke with. But frankly she didn't have any empathy when I expressed my concerns that the service has gone drastically gone down.  Once I told her that I was only contacting her because I care about this property and the Fairmont brand, and did not want anything free or comped she seemed relieved. I am happy to pay for luxury hospitality, as that's what I signed up for. However that is certainly not what the Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghirardelli Sq offers any longer."

        "review_text": "As a Lifetime Gold Elite Marriott AND Starwood, I've had the pleasure of staying recently at the JW Bangkok; JW Mumbai; JW New Orleans and now the JW Chicago and while hotels overseas are renowned for taking care of their guests and especially elite members, GM Timbo, without much notice, made this elite member rank her property no less than all the ones mentioned above and on par with service with Marriott's Asian Properties, world renowned for  service excellence. As an Elite Member, Timeshare Owner of multiple units and personal investor in Marriott, I really felt the welcome mat rolled out and it is deeply appreciated.Coming up  from Milwaukee and Las Vegas (Bellagio where I was treated royally), I was arriving late and very tired so reached out to request a decent room upgrade in a quiet area and a room blocked,  not one assigned last minute (i.e. near the elevator). As busy as GM Timbo was, I was expecting a response from one of her employees (if at all) and was stunned to see her reach out directly with a note that subject to availability she would find me a nice room on my arrival.Checking in  with my CEO (who I convinced to stay here also), Vince was excellent and gave us a great recommendation for a steak/seafood restaurant and Mat the concierge did the booking. When I checked into a room...actually that's an insult, when I checked into my upgrade I was blown away with how nice it was and a  special welcome note and amenity from GM Timbo. Each of the JWW's mentioned took  care of me in recognition of my status, with awesome amenities,  but this has to be one of the nicest Marriott suites I have stayed in  (although hard to beat the Penthouse at the W a couple of weeks ago in NYC). Everyone who we interfaced with was super friendly, efficient and courteous...all a tribute to the leadership by example GM Timbo clearly demonstrates tops down!The property is well lit up, has a great foyer, lobby ,lounge, great gym and a wonderful Marriott Club on the 12th floor. It\u2019s right down town and within walking distance to great  restaurants. Make no mistake this is a luxurious Hotel and its one that's clearly well managed, great for business and well as personal trips and ranks as one of the best JWs I have stayed in worldwide. All a tribute to Ms. Timbo and her staff who all Rock!!"

        "review_text": "I first visited the Kahala when I was 6 years old, some 50 years ago.  At that time, it was a Hilton International Hotel.  I returned as a guest many (40-50) times over the years, through ownership and management changes (Hilton to Mandarin Oriental to Kahala Hotel).Even as the silk rugs and fine furniture in the lobby gave way to jute rugs and Crate and Barrel-esque case goods replacements, the Kahala remained a special place because of the quality of its personnel who went to heroic efforts to make new and returning guests alike feel at home.All good things come to an end and, painfully, nowhere is this more true than with the Kahala.The old guard has retired, the new staff conveys little more than a civil service work ethic, the carpet is worn, a number of terrace railings are rusted, the once charming dolphin pond has been converted to a crass \u201cpay to play\u201d commercial undertaking, the plantings are poorly maintained, etc.Plumeria Beach House has devolved into little more than a glorified fast food restaurant.Hoku\u2019s is the one saving grace: its food and service remain first-rate.A number of reviewers continue to speak highly of the Kahala.  Either they do not know the difference or they never had the good fortune to know the old Kahala.For those who know the difference, a visit to the Kahala is a sad experience."

        "review_text": "Cancel your reservations at the Chicago Ritz immediately and go to a non-strike affected hotel. Check the Chicago Tribune website for details for Chicago loop and Mag Mile area hotels not affected.There is a wide-spread hotel worker strike in Chicago related to healthcare benefits for workers, especially those who are laid off in the slower winter months.The Ritz, in my opinion, has handled this situation very poorly. Not a word was mentioned when we checked in. You are left to discover what services aren\u2019t available at the hotel. The restaurants, bars, room service, and spa seem to be particularly hard hit. There is no restaurant, there is no bar, there is no room service, the mini bars are empty. The phone at the front desk is rarely answered \u2014 when it is it is after 500 rings and multiple attempts.I fully believe in workers\u2019 right to organize, collectively bargain and strike. I am not sure whether the Chicago Ritz shares those values. In and around the hotel over the past two days, I have heard several workers make inappropriate comments about the striking workers who are properly picketing and marching within sight and earshot of the Ritz lobby.Shame on you Ritz Carlton \u2014 you know the striking workers are members of a recognized union with an expired agreement and they have every right to strike, picket and protest. They also have every right to bring your questionable business practices related to employee health insurance benefits to the attention of your guests and the media.Multiple of your employees on duty have said the strike \u201ccame out of the blue, by a text message.\u201d That has to be a lie. The agreement expired at the end of August. It couldn\u2019t have been a surprise.From my perspective - given the nature of your business, your longstanding experience and reputation in the industry and especially the prices you charge for lodging and services - I would expect that you would provide excellent benefits to your full-time employees (your \u201cladies and gentleman\u201d as you say) including those who are temporarily laid off due to seasonal occupancy variations.So escape from the Chicago Ritz while you can. There are a number of excellent hotels in the loop and Michigan Avenue area that are not affected by the strike. Importantly, if you have to stay at the Ritz and find your experience lacking as compared to what you would expect for your rate, ask for a significant adjustment to your stay rate or a return of your Marriott/ Ritz or SPG points.I say shame on you Ritz for reasons too many to count. I am a regular and longstanding loyal Marriott and Ritz customer and this situation is bad news. You should simply pick up the phone, text or email your customers and let them know what is going on before they show up to check in and it is too late for them to cancel their reservations. You owe your customers that much, in addition to a significant rate reduction."

        "review_text": "I had a wedding at the Kahala. We had friends and family members stay for an average of three nights. Although the wedding itself was amazing (good location; and great food and beverage service), the service and experience at the hotel was horrible. Here is what happened to us-1. We got a smoking room, when we explicitly told them that we were nonsmokers and did not want a smoking room or smoking floor. When I complained, they moved us. They thought they were doing us a favor, and decided to move us two hours before the wedding ceremony.2. They got our luggage mixed up, and delivered someone else's luggage twice. They told us that they were confused by the fact that so many people had the same first name initial, and last name.3. My friend's laundry went missing. She had gotten it sent out to be cleaned, but some of her clothes never made it back.4. We tried to get a fork and knife from room service. When we called, there was no response and we were placed on hold for five minutes. Then we were told that it was OUR fault since we were calling at a busy time of the day. My friend, who works in the travel industry, had to tell them that they should then staff accordingly.5. The bellman attempted to throw our luggage into the trunk--he missed and the luggage hit the rental car, leaving a scratch. He said, \"Wow..That was heavier than I thought.\" My partner had to load up our own luggage as we were leaving.6. The worst part has been the billing and accounting/reservations desk. There was a charge on my credit card I didn't understand. When I called the resort to ask where the charge came from, they passed the blame onto each other--the reservation blaming the accounting, etc. it's been 48 hours, and no one has explained to me where the charge came from and to whom it pertains. I also had to remind them about the 500 room deposit, and ask for it. I wonder: what would have happened if I didn't double, triple check all of my bills and invoices from the wedding?7. The staff at the front desk were rude, and treated us pretty much like garbage.I have stayed at other Leading Hotels of the World, including the Shilla and the Faisano in Brazil. The Kahala does not deserve to be part of LHW. In fact, the night before we checked into the Kahala, we stayed in a small hotel in Waikiki that was a third of the price. The service we received there was far superior to that from the Kahala."

        "review_text": "My husband and I love going to the Christkindlmarket in Chicago. It runs from Black Friday to Christmas Eve on Daley Plaza.  We live in NWI and usually train it to the city, go to the festival, and head back home.  This time, we decided to stay in the city.  We picked the Kinzie Hotel, because of it's location (from the festival & due to the myriad of restaurants and bars) and Chicago theme.The front desk staff are phenomenal!  Everyone is very eager to help out, and they're very friendly.The room we stayed in was awesome.  Love the map of Chicago on the wall.  Our view was great, too.My husband and I look forward to staying there again this year!"

        "review_text": "Creative hotspot! This was an amazing booking - all based on the contemporary rooms and 30ft. Plinko game in the lobby. That's right! Plinko. Fantastic location - close to everything. Hotel staff were on the ball - friendly, and available for whatever we needed with answers to all of our questions. Thank you for always having an extra umbrella available! Room was immaculate - clean, spacious enough and an Illy espresso maker. Can't get better than that! The lobby was HOPPING every night. A great gathering spot for locals and tourists alike. Games room and \"chill\" areas are brilliant. Make sure to play Plinko and jenga. So much fun! Brunch at The Cavalier was spectacular! One of the best brunch menus I have ever experienced. Will definitely be returning to the Zetta again. I would recommend this hotel to everyone."

        "review_text": "SHORT VERSION: Stayed May 21-29, 2017. In case you don't read this entire review, let me say up front that all the positive reviews are true. I've stayed here over 40 nights since 2003. I really do know what I'm talking about. In short: Stay here. Splurge on a Diamond Head Ocean View room. Sip cocktails and take in the Hawaiian music and classic Hula at House Without a Key at sunset.  Eat breakfast at Orchids (beautiful view and they actually wait on you...much more relaxed than the self-serve buffet at House Without a Key). Dine at Orchids or La Mer. You will have a grand time! Your soul will feel renewed! The entire hotel staff is second to none. They will treat you like royalty. You will be spoiled for anything else. If you want crowds and excitement (or less expensive options), just cross the street in front of the hotel...This is an IDEAL location, with none of the negatives of Waikiki. This is a WONDERUL hotel. We truly love it. AND...I assure you, It's still as good as it always was.SO YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED: Don't expect a large (or even mid-sized) beach (not happening here...but you can walk a bit to get to one). Their pool is a decent size, heated and aesthetically gorgeous, but no hot tub. No water slides or water features. No zoo-like atmosphere. If you have children older than toddlers, or are looking to concentrate on beach activities, perhaps other hotels might better meet your needs. Only you know what is best for your family.---Now for Details, if you have the time. Hope it helps you --------SPECIAL THINGS:  Take the weekly Back of the House Tour, with Auntie Melba. It's fascinating! You find out what goes on behind the scenes to make it all work so seamlessly. Take the Historic Halekulani Tour with Hi'inani, where you'll get a 90-minute cultural and historic perspective on what makes this hotel so magically special.ROOM SELECTION: Go to the Halekulani's website and find the graphic that shows the layout of the hotel, with color-coded room category locations. It's really helpful. Get an idea of relative costs associated with different categories and packages.  Then, CALL the Halekulani's Reservations Department and make your arrangements through them directly. They can give you great insights as to best rates and specific room options. I'm glad I did, even though I am a multiple-repeat guest, because I was able to enter some special requests, as well as make sure I understood exactly what view I would have from what room.  They will be honest with you about rooms.For example, some of the oceanfront category rooms are set back a bit, and you might not realize this. Some of the ocean view category rooms (and even partial ocean view) have generous to respectable views, so do ask for advice from these very friendly and knowledgeable reservation agents. It could save you money. But see next paragraph for MY ultimate room preference.The Halekulani's balconies are very generously sized and furnished with a table and two chairs, plus a reclining lounger. It's always a pleasure to spend time on your balcony with a beautiful view. I HIGHLY recommend the Diamond Head Ocean Front View...it's breathtaking. It costs more, but it's just enchanting. We spent the first four nights in oceanfront, the last four nights in Diamond Head Ocean view. The latter view is definitely more than worth the price differential.SURROUNDING AREA:  Understand going in that Waikiki is very crowded and built up, but you would never know that when you are actually AT this hotel.   It's completely serene and quiet.  Yet...you can walk across Kalia RD to Beach Walk (a shopping/dining area) in a matter of nano-seconds, and be right in the thick of everything...Hawaiian music groups performing free at Beach Walk pavilion, Roy's restaurant, Ruth Chris Steakhouse, Blue Ginger Apparel, Kahala Sportswear, Honolulu Cookie Company, Starbucks, etc. Scores of shops. A block further to ALL levels of shopping, from Gucci and Prada to Macy's. Long's Drug Store (CVS) and ABC stores nearby have all your travel needs very reasonably priced.  There's even a Denny's right in front of this hotel! I kid you not!!! You'll not run out of options for diversion.When we were there, the local Community College's Culinary School was just opening a little cafe/restaurant right across from the Halekulani in the Waikiki Parc Hotel (former site of the Nobu restaurant, and before that, the Waikiki Parc Cafe). The menu sounded great, and VERY reasonably priced. Wish we could have had a chance to sample it! If you can, go and support the budding chefs for us!BEST TIMES TO STAY: Mid-to-latter part of May is a nice time to visit Hawaii. It is after the \"Golden Week\" in early May (when many Japanese guests travel because of three successive holidays within a 10-day period) and before the schools on the mainland USA let out. We've also found April and October/November/early to mid December to be less crowded in Hawaii (especially Waikiki) than other times. Watch out for the Honolulu Marathon, which is held early in December...that can complicate things somewhat.  As I said before, the great thing about the Halekulani is: No matter how crowded Waikiki gets, you always feel serene and relaxed when you're on the hotel's property. It's really true.SECURITY AND RULE ENFORCEMENT:  When researching for this visit, I was dismayed to find a negative review, complaining that standards had slipped and security was less. I can honestly tell you that we found NO evidence of ANY such thing. The security guards (in black suits) are still on guard everywhere you look. No intruders are walking around the pool, having wandered in from the street or the beach. We felt completely safe, and we also never saw ANY hint of smoking on balconies. There are a few designated smoking areas (one in front of the hotel, on the street). Other than that, the guests honored the no-smoking policy of the hotel...at least as far as we could see. Considering we spent over a week here, and I really checked for all of this, I feel confident in assuring all of you that everything is STILL just as genteel, safe, pleasant, clean, and quiet as it always was here.  And THAT is saying something.CONCIERGES:   The Concierges will do ANYTHING for you. They can pull rabbits out of hats, and DO, with great regularity. And they are not there to sell tours or tickets. They are there for the guests, and your best interests are their only concern. They provided me with packing materials and shipped my packages, steered me toward some of the best experiences, took care of everything. And I never had to wait to speak with them, like at so many other hotels. There are always several concierges on duty, and they are at it from morning until 10 p.m. every night. They seem able to get you reservations at almost any restaurant, sometimes even last-minute. Amazing service!CONCLUSION: Stay here, even if you have to save up for a long time (like we do). It's worth it. There is a level of luxury and service here that is beyond that of ANY other Waikiki hotel. You will be treated to multiple excellent food options (with elegant ambiance), highly personalized service, outstanding spa services, and a large, comfortable room. Get an ocean view room, whatever you do...preferably on a high floor, above any rooftops. You didn't come all the way to Hawaii to look at anything less."

We've never seen a TV that was inside the bathroom mirror, and that was mind blowing. We loved the security of the hotel as well. You never know how Chicago is going to be. This was my first time in Chicago. I felt save and satisfied. I am also a huge Trump fan so it was an honor to stay in Chicago for my first time in Chicago. #Trump2020"

The location is also great - close to transit and shopping.  However, the corridors are dark and the room we were assigned (on a complimentary upgrade) was also dark - the lighting inadequate and shades not something to open as we would look right into our neighbors rooms, whose shades were certainly closed as well.  The bathroom shower was small and leaked (sprayed) all over the rest of the bathroom.  I love modern, boutique hotels, but next time I am in San Francisco, I will seek out a different one."

They are short staffed and it shows in the lack of service. Quality of the rooms (bedding, linens, towels, etc) is not up to snuff. The lobby borders on tacky and for a good meal you have to leave the hotel. Overpriced and definitely not worth it."

        "review_text": "After checking out of our room after only staying forone night, I accidentally left my three diamond rings on the nightstand, which I take full responsibility for doing. I had my two kids with me, who were arguing so I just wanted to leave and get home. When I realized 1.5 hours later that I had left my rings at the hotel and they were not on my fingers, my husband called the hotel Immediately to try to locate them. The Head of security was very good about filling us in on what they were doing to try to locate the rings; the room was locked down to try to find the rings, the staff that entered the room had all been interviewed about the rings, the linen company was contacted, and following up days later to tell us nothing had been found.It is now two weeks later and my rings have not been located and I am sure will not be found at this point. Unfortunately, on top of all of this, a few days later, I was charged an additional $10 for a \"Missing Four Seasons towel\" from our room, which was never taken by me or any of my family members during our stay.  Thankfully, that charge has been removed from our bill as of today.I am completely surprised and disappointed at the way this entire experience has been handled, especially from a \"Five Star\" hotel like The Four Seasons.  I had to make a a call to the genera manager myself, instead of him calling me to see how the situation was handled. I would've hopedand expected that I would've at the very least been compensated in some way for the loss of my rings and not made to feel by the GM or the hotel that It was my fault and that I probably just misplaced my rings and they were somewhere in my house or luggage. Trust me, I have looked in every possible location, backwards and forwards, at least a million times.After my husband emailed the GM directly, here was a portion of his response:\"The housekeeper who cleaned your room followingdeparture is a long time employee who has a historyof handing in lost and found including items of veryhigh value and cash. We have concluded ourinvestigation and have not been able to locate therings on property and also have found no suspicious activities.  I apologize if we have made you to feel that you are at fault as that was not our intention. I am also sorry that you were mistakenly charged fora missing towel and am glad to hear that we have corrected that error.\"That was it!!  Someone is obviously not telling the truth because my rings are gone and I have aPicture that I took that night in the room where you see the reflection of my rings in the window and I did not leave the room after that point.  Maybe a giftcard for a future stay or credit my account for myone night's horrible experience...NOTHING!After this experience, I will never spend the moneyto stay at any other Four Seasons hotel ever again,which is very sad because I'm sure not all of their hotels deal with situations in this manner.  We did stay at The Four Seasons in Maui and had nothingbut a wonderful experience.  I have never felt this violated and disrespected before, and the fact that I had to PAY for that type of experience, makes it even worse."

Shortly after arriving I started noticing random insect bites, by the time my stay was over my upper torso was covered, contacted Aston and was not even able to speak to a manager.  I then contacted the booking agency I went through.  A few days later I received an email from the safety and security manager apologizing for my experience with \"bed bugs\".  I then returned requested pictures of the bites.  A week or so later I received an email from the booking agent that an outside insurance company would contact me regarding this issue.  They claimed that the bite marks were not consitent with this particular bug as the bites were random and not in a row.  However they would send a complaint form to my home address.  That was almost 3 weeks ago and still have not received anything.  I have sent return emails to the manager of safety and security who hand originally contacted me as well as the cooperative PR office and have heard nothing in response."

They took really good care of us and made us feel at home.The hotel facilities are luxurious and spotlessly clean. We were amazed. It has a modern feel and the rooms are super well decorated and looking brand new. The beds are soft and comfy, the shower has a lot of space and the water temperature and pressure is just perfect! The A/C is so silent you don\u2019t even notice it is there, and it works really well. Wi-Fi signal was fast and strong everywhere, which was crucial for us since we had work to do online and needed a fast connection.We got the Sky Club suite, with access to the rooftop sky lounge at the 16th floor, and it was totally worth it. Such an amazing view, specially for watching the sunset! And their happy hour is also a biiig plus. Yummy food and delicious cocktails. :)The pool area is super cute and a great spot for some photos!The hotel serves delicious food in all it\u2019s bars and restaurants. Breakfast was the best. So many options and flavors! You could pretty much taste Thailand itself without leaving the hotel. HeheBesides all this, the location is super convenient. Right next to the boat pier that takes you to the city center in a couple of minutes. They also have a tuktuk and shuttle service available that is very convenient as well.Me and my boyfriend had an amazing experience and can\u2019t wait to be back! I totally recommend. Hotels like this make the best experiences, in my opinion. :) Thank you so much for the amazing stay.Khob khun kha!"

We have now been told that we need to pay double the amount or it will be cancelled and due to the holiday dates approaching there is limited options at much higher rates than we had before.

I requested for us to check in in the meantime while deciding whether to book for an additional room, or to go to another hotel, but they said they only allow my family 30 minutes to decide! They only allowed 2 guests in a room, any more than that was prohibited to enter ! Ridiculous! We had a pleasant journey in Bangkok & Pattaya staying at different hotels but only this hotel gave me a bad impression. Not only were the staff unfriendly, not even help us & yet restricted us. The luxury room shower gets easily flooded with water as drainage system bad & the beds were rock hard. Definitely not worth staying in such a hotel.& yet spoil our holiday by staying here...."

        "review_text": "I like my review short and straight to the point. I am sure you are reading this because you want to know more about details not stated in website or blogs.=Room=I booked an one bedroom suite.I was shown to my room by one of the staff. Brief explanation on the amenities and stuffs of the room.2 room cards were given.Immediately, I am glad I booked this apartment for my 5 days stay in Bangkok.I come to Bangkok at least twice every year, and I often change hotels/apartment to have a feel and experience of every recommended ones in the cities. Adelphi Fourty-Nine certainly deserved its ranking in the top 5 of Bangkok and I may not look elsewhere anymore.At 50m2, the one bed room suite is big and spacious enough for couples.TV brand - Sharp, although channels were not in High Definition, it is very watchable. Size of the TV is about 32 inches. There is also a smaller TV in the bedroom.Blueray Player brand - SamsungWasher/ Dryer brand - Samsung, It is good, I am using an upgraded version of this washer/dryer at my own home too. Washing capacity 8kg, Drying capacity 6kg. Powder detergent will be provided by the hotel.There are fridge, microwave oven, dining table, sofa dining chair, a mini kitchen with induction hob and hood and all the washing necessities.A very spacious wardrobe, ironing board, hairdryer, and safebox.The sofa in the living room is L-Shaped, able to sit 3 pax.There is a mini balcony with table and chairs and also a drying rack for air drying your clothes.There is a router in every room and WIFI signal is very strong and will not disconnect. You do not need to log in everytime you activate your WIFI. Definitely a plus point.Bed Size is King Size.Bathroom has a bathtub, rain shower, and it is almost the size of the bedroom, it is very big and spacious.The toilet bowl used advanced tankless system, and is made in Korea equipped with bidet combo technology for your hygiene washing and drying. It also comes with seat warmer.I will let my pictures do the talking.Room Quality: 4.8/5=Breakfast=First impression on a first day, awesome.The american breakfast varieties isn't the best, but it will satisfy your daily breakfast intake.As I am staying there for 4 nights, I noticed certain dishes stayed the same, only dishes like soup, porridge, and noodles will change everyday.The rest is your usual baked potatoes, tomatoes, fruits, white bread, brown bread, breakfast cereal, yogurt, coffee, tea, etc.Upon entering the restaurant, the staff will asked how you like your eggs to be done. There are about 6 varieties you can choose.The quality of the food is good though.Breakfast: 4/5 overall.=Hotel's Restaurant=It's restaurant is called Azul.On the first night, it was raining, so we had dinner at the hotel's restaurant.Trust me when I say this, the food quality is so good, I can eat like an elephant.We ordered pineapple fried rice and carbonara.Food Quality: 4.9/5=Location=The apartment It is located near Thong Lor BTS.On a slow walk, it will take 8mins from the hotel to the BTS.The hotel provide van services from 6am to 10pm to fetch you back and forth from hotel to Sukhumvit  Soi 51. They do not drive you straight to the exit of Thong Lor BTS.The point where they drop you will just be a 1min walk to Thong Lor BTS Exit.If you choose to walk, you will passby Japanese restaurant, Korean restaurant, 1 massage joint, supermarket, hairsalon, korean beauty shop, and the important 7-11 shop.There is Oasis Spa nearby, so anyone up for a luxurious spa treatment can just walk 1min to it.If you are familiar with Bangkok like me, you will know about the delicious street food nearby, at Sukhumvit Soi 38. Just google for this, I won't type irrelevant details here as this is a hotel review.=Hotel Facilities=There is a gym and infinity pool at level 7.You will need to tap your hotel card whenever you use the lift.The pool has a standard depth throughout at 1.2 meters.There is also a sun tanning area above the pool.I used both facilities, it is clean and good.Gym and Pool closed at 10pm.Facilities: 4/5Overall, I just want to say I am glad I found this place.To anyone who wants a comfortable stay in Bangkok. I strongly recommend this place.You do not need to squeeze with typical tourists at those \"so called\" popular hotels near tourist spots/attractions which will cost much more per night and quality isn't as good as Adelphi Fourty-Nine.The hotel require you to place a 2000baht cash deposit upon check-in. so do prepare your cash ready.If there are any questions, feel free to ask me, and if this review helps you in any way, do give me a LIKE.Enjoy your planning and holiday."

        "review_text": "Given the rating for this hotel, I saved our stay there for the last two nights of our trip to Oahu. We had very high expectations to say the least. We had reserved an ocean view room but then before we arrived were upgraded to an ocean front room at a rate of $655 per night for two people. Upon our arrival we were promptly greeted but as expected our room was not ready so we spent time walking around the pool area and relaxing in the lobby. The lobby is very beautiful as I had expected it would be. Once our room was ready, we were escorted to it by an employee. We were given a room on the third floor. the minute we stepped off the elevator I was surprised to see how dowdy the hallway was, reminded me of a holiday inn in the 70's. dark, worn out carpet & marked up walls. the room was tiny & just as worn out. we faced the pool and very limited ocean view, for sure did not meet our definition of ocean front. I asked the employee who brought us to the room if the higher floors had better views (as the pics on their website showed) and he barely even responded. I decided to call front desk and tell them I wasn't very happy about our room...they didn't even ask me why, much less offer to show me other rooms. The could have cared less! So we checked out & I want to tell you this....the silver lining to this story is that we called the Four Seasons at Ko Olina, formerly the JW Marriott, and moved there...what a stunning property it is!!! that is a whole other review coming up. take your money to the Four Seasons and forget the Halekulani....it is a \"has been\" property."

        "review_text": "In June I booked 3 rooms with the Cosmopolitan.  One for my Daughter and Fianc\u00e9 for 2 nights in a regular room and on the 3rd and 4th nights, a Premium Wraparound Suite with a wedding reception being held there after the wedding.  And one room for me and my husband for 3 nights.  I would call periodically from June to September to verify the rooms and was told yes, everything was good.  I even made arrangements through the hotel for them to cater the Reception.  Even the day we checked in, I was told everything was in order and good to go.  On the day of the wedding, my daughter checked out of the regular room and tried to check in to the suite.  They were told the suite was no longer available and they would give her another room.  My daughter was in tears.  We went down to talk to the front desk manager and she was no help at all, her attitude was this is the way it is, take it or leave. They finally found another suite for us, but it was not the one that I had made reservations for.  WE WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN."

        "review_text": "the ghost doesn't seem mean. One night there I woke up in the middle of the night to sounds coming from the bathroom.  I thought my roommate was moving around toiletries but when I screamed her name, she was still in her bed.  We were both terrified. It didn't help that the room was completely pitch black because there were no windows.  As soon as we acknowledged the ghost, it seemed to have stopped.  This happened again one more night...once we greeted the ghost, the noises slowly stopped.  Ironically in spite of all of this, I would recommend the hotel for the location and cost and overall helpfulness of the staff."

        "review_text": "My husband and I stayed here for my husbands  30th birthday. When we arrived we upgraded our room and was everything we wanted. The only thing was there was a really bad smell of weed In the room. We never complaint tho as we\u2019re not the type to complain. Until our 3rd day in we came bank in from shopping my husband accidentally stood on my toe so I called him a few names with fright he said sorry and everything was fine we start getting ready to go back out. When security knocked on my door dragged me out of the room then put my husband in hand cuffs and asked him for the safe code where all our money was.. they then brought my husband and I down to interview rooms I was so scared and couldn\u2019t stop crying as I couldn\u2019t understand what was happening. Security then said they had called the police. I couldn\u2019t believe this. When I asked why security said they believed there had been a domestic. Both me and my husband told them everything was fine. When the police came they asked me and my husband which one of us wanted to be arrested I was hysterical at this stage cos nothing made sense why one of us where been arrested. My husband said no way where they arresting me to take him. They then handcuffed my husband charged him for domestic battery 1st for no reason he was held in jail for 48 hours. After they took my husband I was told I had 10 mins to pack my stuff and leave the hotel. Could it actually get any worse the answer is yes as I went to pack all my belongings I notice the safe was empty I just thought then my husband had put the money into his bag that I had it\u2019s only when I went to check into the aria I realised the money was gone and it was security of the cosmopolitan that was at my safe last.. so please never stay at this hotel cause the security are DIRTY and rob you. It was all set up but went to far it\u2019s disgraceful that they will just get away with it."

Stayed in room 1505, small room but honestly not an issue once you in there, comfy and facilities superb. Location just minutes walk to beach and they provide you towels, chairs, boards etc. On checking out got offered an hour in complimentary room that day so we could check bags with them in morning, go to beach, stayed there all day(Flight was that night) came back got bags and freshened up and changed, brilliant and free! Breakfast again small choices perhaps but very nice choices and a nice place to sit and eat. Cannot say enough about the hotel or the staff, amazing gem of a hotel."

Hotel has a very hip vibe and the bar was very crowded during my evening check-in. My room was upgraded (thanks!) to an 8th floor. Room was spacious and modern. Great wireless internet connection and bed was very comfortable. Very easy walk to Moscone Center. All that said, bill for room and parking for one night came out to over 500 bucks ($55 to park overnight). That is less than I paid per night for the nicest luxury hotel in Switzerland!. Zetta is very chic and service is great, but not a value at that price."

        "review_text": "I picked this hotel because it was such a good price and had such great reviews. Normally the lower the price the lower the reviews, it ended up being the best decision for my first trip to Hawaii. Right off the bat I will say that this is what you might call a budget hotel, unless you shell out some more money the rooms are small and you won't get a beach view, but for me I don't need all that because I was barely in the room other than to sleep and shower. We had a double bed room and it was perfect. It had a fridge, a safe, comfortable, clean beds and a tv.The thing that puts this hotel over the top for me was considering it is a lower priced hotel it had awesome accommodations. When you check in you get wonderful smelling cool towels for your face along with a cold glass of pineapple juice. The employees are friendly and very helpful. We had so many questions during our stay and they always were able to help with transportation or pointing us the right way to something. They have beach towels, beach mats, boogie boards, umbrellas and chairs available for you to use at the beach which is a straight walk out of the hotel and two blocks away. Awesome breakfast, with all kinds of breads, fruit, sausage rolls, muffins etc That saves so much money on food costs, which is greatly needed with the restaurant prices for food. They hold your luggage till check in and if your flight is late they will hold your luggage after check out and offer you a courtesy room to clean up in if you want to spend time at the beach the day before you go.Also the decor is just very lovely, the breakfast area is not traditional tables, but really trendy chairs/couches and tables. They have a library for you to borrow books for the beach as well as two computers for you to print anything you need. I really just can't say enough about this hotel, I felt like I got so much more than I paid for. They made our stay great, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants great accommodations for a great price."

        "review_text": "Very very delighted to have chosen the right hotel for a short excursion for me and a few of my friends. The location is perfect with a pretty large  mall around its corner... A Blue Bottle Cafe... Which is less than 5 minutes away from the hotel.. All the other areas are at walking distance...Their front desk managed to get me checked in 2 hours earlier.. They found out there were 2 birthdays in this group, and scored us complimentary bottles of wine (1 for each).. We got assigned to the top floor corner room 803 with a beautiful view.Their staff are all polite and I couldn't help myself looking at how well dressed, young, hip, ultra chic their male staff are with plaid shirts, and beret looking hats. Nate stood out among  everyone else as the most friendliest, approachable.The hotel itself appears to cater more to the young urban demographic. I've read that it could get noisy... But we didn't experience that.. They have a bar on the first floor that you can have socials with while sucking fresh shucked oysters!The decor everywhere is modern. The room was equipped with the jawbone.. We enjoyed listening to our 80s music via Bluetooth. The room was spacious and clean. It did not look like it was dated.The hotel itself is active in promoting to stay green.. Their waste basket has a separate divider for recyclables as well.When I'm in town, I will be back here at Zetta. Thank you! I had a memorable 40th."

        "review_text": "We are on the final night of an eight night stay, and have been left left with a rather bitter taste. We have visited this hotel at least six times over the past 10 years and have made many happy family memories with our two children (now 10 and 6 years).We were very much looking forward to returning as the hotel reopened after its refurbishment but, despite a few minor improvements, we feel that the overall standard of the hotel has dropped and it no longer provides a luxurious family stay and therefore am unlikely to return.The good points:- the surfacing around the pools is much safer- nothing to really dislike about the overall feel of the new decor but feels a little uninspiring and cold- the children\u2019s club is improved- dedicated childrens beds instead of shuffling furniture around (just a shame they were not treated to duvets and had a make-do blanket in a sheet)The bad points:- the main breakfast and dining area lacks any ambience- fewer staff around the pools etc- water is no longer brought out in ice buckets so ends up tepid very quickly in the sunshine- the marina and marina beach is closed off - this was a favourite with our children as it provided very calm water for bathing and kayaking- fewer places to choose from for evening meals- a dreadful toxic smell from the very strong adhesives being used in the corridor outside our room on three separate days of our stay (the workmen were wearing masks!)- music constantly being played all day at Wild Wadi, the main pool and the children\u2019s pool - the whole place used to have a very relaxing peacefulness but now feels more like Club 18-30!- and the biggest issue we have had has been the overwhelming loud music throughout the evenings when trying to get our children to sleep. There was a concert here on our second or third night which, quite literally, was the loudest music I have ever heard (our room is 13 floors up) and our windows and even the beds were vibrating. It was that loud that our 10 year old was crying for it to stop. There was also a wedding party last evening which had very loud disco music, and this evening we are being \u2018treated\u2019 to another live act which is apparently a cocktail party. In no way can this hotel continue to promote itself as \u2018family friendly\u2019 as it is impossible for children to go to sleep with the constant adult entertainment until 11pm.Sadly, the JBH has very much gone down in our opinion!"

        "review_text": "This has nothing to do as Trump the President but a review of the actions and treatment that My wife and I received from the hotel staff at this hotel.I reserved a spa room for my wife and I for our anniversary weekend getaway. At the time of reservation they had no problem taking my credit card information for the reservation s but when we arrived to said hotel that was a different story we showed up to get the keys and enjoy our night together when they said that they would not except my card that I made the reservation with due to it being a prepaid card. Which is not specified in any part of the fine print in the contract of the reservation. So the first worker said that they just need a card with a name on it and it could be paid for with the original card. We told they not to change anything to that card as we did not have enough money on that card and no way to transfer funds for one account to the other since we were over three hours away from home and it was late on Saturday night. So they ran it it did not go through and the worked was told to cancel the transaction .He said he did and left to come back with a front end manager. Whom said that we could pay in cash so I went and pulled all the money I could for the day out of their ATM to cover the cost of the room and as I went to pay cash she told me it would be an additional $500.00 for the room because I was paying with cash. At this time my wife was fed up with the way that we had been treated by the worker and the front end manager that she stormed out and as I told them to just cancel the room the front end manager had no remorse for the situation and basically stated that it was not their fault and was unwilling to help in any way. So we even had to pay for the 1 hour long parking in their garage I was so disappointed in the way that they looked down on us and that they made it feel that we should not be staying there to begin with. And that hurt even more so my wife and I scrambled to find another hotel in the area at 7 pm at night and came across a wonderful hotel called the Parker House and it was a beautiful historical hotel much better than what I seem from the Trump hotel. They were more than happy to help us get the room and take care of us. But what was even worse is that the Trump hotel CHARGED US THE FEE FOR THE REGISTRATION TWO DAY LATER.... So we called our bank to see what the charge was and through our bank we even called the Hotel and the manager stated that that situation never happened and that we were charged as a no show and refused to refund the fee....So we were charged for the night and did not even stay there.. I will never recommend any of my friends or business partners that travel and stay in Chicago to stay at this establishment. And they all agree and will be spending there time and money at great hotel like Parker House while doing business in Chicago......I hope that they will see this and try to make it right but I will not hold my breath....."

        "review_text": "Do not reserve a luxury suite at the Red Rock!!! I've had one of the most awful experiences in my life dealing with the Red Rock Hotel.  I rented a penthouse suite for a birthday party for 50.  During my party, the room temp was over 80 degrees. After notifying hotel personnel serving my party, it took almost 2 hours for engineering to arrive to try to fix the air conditioner which they never did.Then, get this, they blamed me for having too many people in the room!!   They took almost $7,000 of my money knowing I was going to have 50+ people and then tried to claim I had too many people.   Unbelievable.It gets worse. When I asked for an accommodation, they refused. They initially had the nerve to tell me I didn't notify them of the issue.  Then, after escalating to the Assistant Hotel Manager named Greg, they refused again claiming they fixed the issue.It gets worse.  After escalating the issue again, Greg claimed I damaged the room and they would have to charge me over $4,000 in damages to artwork and furniture.  I literally had to drive to the hotel to defend myself from them.  After demanding to see the suite and the damage, miraculously the damaged art was from \"another room\" and the damaged headrest to a chair was nowhere to be found and a \"misunderstanding.\"After defending these false allegations, I once again escalated the initial air temperature issue and asked to speak to the Hotel Manager, Shane Hamlett.  He refused. The Red Rock Hotel offered me a whopping $100 for my trouble.  After indicating I was insulted they increased it to $400. These people are simply unbelievable.Do not reserve a luxury suite from these people!"

I try reason with them it's the same price whether i put 02 or 03 guests stay but they insisted it's different price.So left with no choices i pay the 4000 Baht which i actually doesn't need to pay at all,and while in the room, i did a check on the hotel online site and surprise me that for the same room the price of 02 or 03 guests is actually same price so i screenshot the 2 different quotation on my phone and i try to request the manager to come up to my room rather then having a quarrel with her in the lobby reception,the manager decline to come up but insisted they do no wrong on charging me extra 4000 baht...Overall the hotel does not want honour our deal because we book through AGODA online site instead of the hotel own site..I am writing this review to warn people who like to book this hotel through 3rd party app.if you are staying for 02 adults then it's fine but if you are big family like mine i guess you need look somewhere else.Recommending your hotel, it's a no no...We are just over disappointed on you even though this is our second time staying with you...I do attach the screenshot of the 2 different in no of guests check in but clearly price is the same.."

A little dated perhaps - but its so comfortable, made me enjoy travel all over again.  Try the restaurant in the building, the cuisine is to die for!! The staff is super accommodating - I am so happy that my \"regular\" hotel couldn't accommodate my visit this time so that I could stay here - can't wait to make it my regular when visiting the DC area!"

        "review_text": "Just stayed for 4 nights at the newly refurbished JBH. Not too sure where to start. Having stayed there for the past 15 years plus, sometimes several times a year, we are booked to stay in May 19, after not being able to stay since last year due to refurb closing the hotel and took the opportunity to take a quick 4 night break at the end of October to see what improvements had been made.Wish I had saved my \u00a35.5k and am now seriously thinking of changing my booking in May next year to Al Naseem where we stayed in May and August whilst JBH was closed.JBH what have you done?The only thing that was still as good as ever was the club staff, where at least Sarah, Agnes and the staff know how to look after their guests!Kitchen Connection, I\u2019ll keep it simple is poor to how Latitude used to be!Executive pool, not so executive with anybody being allowed to sneak in and use the facilities! Plus no staff on hand to help relieve me of my hard earned cash! Although Earl and the guys are very cheery & helpful, they were so understaffed it was a shame for them.Beachcombers is still excellent and the staff very helpful and attentive, only thing that let it down was the suit, sorry management that belittle the staff in front of the clientele. And I can assure you that the staff member that was being embarrassed was doing an excellent job before the young manager waded in and shared his obvious years of experience that he had just gained at college!On a positive, although the refurb is still being finished off, I do like the new decor, it is light and airy but the lifts are now so dark and claustrophobic that it depresses you every time you get in one, which takes away the chilled and relaxed feeling that you had before you got in!Main pool area is definitely more user friendly.I know that this is a sweeping statement, as this does not apply to all, but the buggy drivers need to be more understanding of their clients and not so rude.Not a lover of the main reception desk, or the staff behind the desk. Didn\u2019t seem to have an understanding for much at all.Can only thank the powers that be that the staff in club kept the old JBH flag flying! The one with \u2018SERVICE\u2019 embroidered on it.If the new GM reads this, take it from someone who worked in your industry for many years, your business will suffer. You can\u2019t charge for five star service when delivering 2, possible 3 stars. Your repeat clients will no longer be repeat and the new will be one stay wonders, which as we all know, doesn\u2019t get anyone rich!Treat your staff as you would wish to be treated yourself and they will in turn do the same to their paying guests.As they say, \u2018It all rolls down hill\u2019.We used to love JBH and have met some lovely people, both guests and staff, but if this is to continue there is definitely a hill to climb.All told, don\u2019t be put off staying, it is beautiful, relaxing and is in a great location. I\u2019m hoping that our stay was only reflective of our past years of excellent service and happy memories and that the JBH is now going through a new born period and should be left to grow and learn, as we all do, from older wiser, grumpy old so an so\u2019s.Let\u2019s just hope that the hotel management are not like my kids that pretend they know it all. Looking at some of the recent reviews, you need to listen and learn, as I wish I had when I was younger and I\u2019d probably be staying in the Burj instead of JBH and not writing this on Trip Advisor! I bet the staff at JBH at saying the same thing..."

        "review_text": "I have stayed at a few hotels in the Union Square area of San Francisco over the last few years, and Hotel Zetta is one of my favorites. This was the second time I've stayed at the property, and it's just as nice as a remembered. The location is perfect if you'll be using public transit. It's next door to the Westfield San Francisco Center, and completely close to plenty of Walgreens. In my case, I usually forget something, so it's nice to not have to search for a place to pick up some essentials. There are plenty of food and bars in the area, but they're mostly mediocre. San Francisco has much better offerings in its other areas.When it comes to the rooms, they are modern and clean. The bed is comfortable and there are some great conveniences like USB charging ports and a portable bluetooth speaker. My only complaint is that there were only two full-size towels in the bathroom. Four would seem way more logical. While I understand that it might be an effort to conserve, it just seems like it's too much of a cut. I don't usually feel like calling for towels, so I'd rather there just have been four in the first place. The bar and communal areas in the hotel are great. The staff was attentive and check-in/out was a breeze.I love Hotel Zetta, and I would stay there again in a minute."

        "review_text": "My girlfriend and I recently spent two nights at the Royal Hawaiian, and we were very happy with our stay. This hotel truly is the grande dame of Waikiki Beach. It\u2019s a lovely, historic hotel that feels like a retreat amongst the hustle and bustle of the surrounding area. Beforehand, we weren\u2019t sure if we would like staying in Waikiki, due to the crowds and congestion, but our worries were all for naught. The \u201cPink Palace on the Pacific\u201d is definitely a must in Waikiki. I only wish that we could have stayed for longer. It\u2019s a unique hotel that is definitely worthy of its spot as part of Starwood\u2019s Luxury Collection. As with any hotel, it has a couple of small issues here and there, but nothing that takes away from the overall experience in a major way.From what I had heard from talking to others and reading about the area, I was nervous to stay on Waikiki Beach. I of course knew it was a famous beach and a classic place to stay on Oahu, so I definitely wanted to spend at least some time here. However, I was worried it would just feel much too crowded and urban to be what we were looking for on a relaxing Hawaiian vacation. We ended up deciding to split our six nights on Oahu so that we\u2019d be at the Royal Hawaiian for two, before moving to what we expected to be a less hectic environment for the rest.It turns out that the way the Royal Hawaiian is situated, you really end up with the best of both worlds in terms of location. It is in a congested urban area, so there absolutely are high-rises, slow-moving city traffic, and crowds of tourists nearby. However, having such a central location in Waikiki, just off of Kalakaua Avenue, is also very convenient. The Royal Hawaiian is right in the center of the action of Kalakaua Avenue, which is essentially like Honolulu\u2019s version of Rodeo Drive. Pretty much any high-end shopping one could want is within walking distance, as are many of the restaurants and other hotels of Waikiki. However, it\u2019s nice that the Royal Hawaiian is at least a bit set back from the commotion, since it\u2019s accessed down a short road off of Kalakaua Avenue that first leads to its sister property next door, the Sheraton Waikiki.  Just go to the left around the circular Sheraton driveway and you\u2019ll find the Royal Hawaiian tucked back on its own. It took me a little bit to realize that there are some shorter footpaths through the gardens to get back out to Kalakaua Avenue from the hotel, so it\u2019s not necessary fastest to walk out taking the same path that you use when driving in, depending on where you\u2019re going.Another important thing to consider is that the Royal Hawaiian is one of the few hotels in Waikiki that is technically beachfront. Some hotels, such as the Sheraton next door, are on the water, but don\u2019t have a beach. Most hotels going in the opposite direction past the Moana Surfrider are near the beach, but across busy Kalakaua Avenue from it, which adds extra congestion and hassle to the beach experience.We definitely spent quite a bit of time researching our room options once we had decided on the Royal Hawaiian. There is a choice between rooms in the main historic building of the hotel or the adjacent tower building. As its name implies, the historic building is where to stay if you like the history of the hotel and are interested in staying in the original hotel in an older room with more character (which is of course renovated). The historic building is basically the main building of the hotel that contains the lobby, front desk, and its promenade of stores, all opening out to the beachfront lawn and Mai Tai Bar on one side, and the pretty Coconut Grove garden area on another. The rooms in the historic building, which were renovated sometime in the past few years, have a d\u00e9cor that looks a bit more classic and fits in with the historic hotel feel. Because it\u2019s such an old building, I could tell just from walking past rooms that were being cleaned that rooms in the historic building can really vary in size and shape. From what I can tell, the historic rooms tend to uniformly have tiny bathrooms, and aren\u2019t necessarily all that large in total square footage.In contrast, the tower building has a very different feel. Rather than being only 5 or 6 stories high, it\u2019s a pink and white high-rise style tower, which was constructed in the late 1960s, and has a look that I guess is starting to look charmingly retro today. It\u2019s a bit of an odd looking building next to the historic wing, but I guess the pink theme ties it all together. We never entered the tower during our stay, but from what I can gather, the tower rooms have a totally different d\u00e9cor versus the historic rooms, which is more of a modern, beachy vibe. Tower rooms also have balconies (which historic rooms don\u2019t have) and all of them offer ocean views, which many historic rooms do not have. This also drives up room rates in the tower relative to the historic building. The only other difference is that the tower is accessed separately by walking down a pretty outdoor covered walkway past the Coconut Grove. The pool and main beach entrance are also right outside the tower elevators. The tower is definitely a better location for those planning to spend more time at the beach, while the historic wing is more convenient for those planning to come and go from the hotel more often via the front door in the lobby.Since returning from our stay, we\u2019ve received promotional emails from the hotel about the tower. It seems that it\u2019s recently been re-named the Mailani Tower, and essentially now functions as a special concierge floor/club level, including things like breakfast and hors d\u2019oeurves in a special lounge for all tower guests. I\u2019m really curious about the execution of these new features, especially since the benefits seem to apply to the entire tower, rather than just a single floor of rooms like a club level would be in most hotels. I\u2019d definitely be interested in trying this out in the future, and it at least provides more justification for why the room rates are so high in the tower.The most basic entry-level rooms at the Royal Hawaiian are Garden View and Grove View in the historic building. It was never totally clear to me how these two views differ, but from what I was told, it seems that the basic Garden View probably looks out at the hotel driveway, while the Grove View looks at the Coconut Grove area, which is quieter and more of a manicured Garden View. Just to be on the safe side, and always leery of booking the bottom-of-the-barrel room, we decided to book the Grove View for about $20 extra per night. After that, we noticed that room rates went up dramatically to upgrade to an Ocean View room or junior suite in the historic building, with exorbitant rates for anything in the tower. We figured that since we were only there two nights, a Grove View would be fine. It also worked out well that these were the cheapest rooms, since I preferred the chance to have the historic building experience anyway.Leading up to our stay, I appreciated that the hotel sent a welcome email from the concierge team and requested additional information from us before our stay, such as confirmation of our Starwood Preferred Guest Membership, any special requests, and whether we were celebrating anything. It was nice to have an easy way to contact the hotel before we arrived. I recommend responding to the email, since it definitely can\u2019t hurt to do so. I mentioned that we were hoping for an early check-in, and that we were celebrating both of our birthdays on our trip. We ended up being extremely happy with the treatment we received, including a great complimentary room upgrade for our birthdays!We arrived at the hotel right around lunchtime, which seemed like a pretty busy time when we pulled up, with both arrivals and departures crossing paths. However, the valet staff was very attentive, greeting my girlfriend with a fresh flower lei and greeting me with a kukui nut lei. Immediately after walking up the stairs into the lobby, I was impressed. The Moorish design of the hotel is very beautiful and unique, so it\u2019s well worth stopping for a moment to take in the intricate ceilings and other elements of the hotel\u2019s design. The lobby extends as a long hallway, and it\u2019s hard not to like how open it is to the outdoors, allowing guests to spill right out onto the lanai to sit in rocking chairs overlooking the lovely Coconut Grove. Especially with everything being in pink (really, there\u2019s pink everywhere), it\u2019s just really unique and fun. I\u2019ve never been to a hotel that looked anything like the Royal Hawaiian.I went to check in when we arrived, hoping, but not really expecting, that we could get into our room around noon. It turned out that our room wasn\u2019t ready, but we were told we\u2019d get a call when it was, with an offer to store our bags in the meantime. The front desk staff member that I dealt with was pretty nice, and definitely professional. However, she wasn\u2019t necessarily the warmest person ever. I found that was the case each time I went to the front desk. They were nice enough, but the warm Hawaii welcome I was expecting wasn\u2019t quite all the way there. I also recall reading that check-in here is done while seated, and that people in the past received things like cool towels or a welcome drink in addition to their leis. We didn\u2019t need anything beyond leis, and our greeting when we pulled up had been very warm. However, I did notice that none of the other things I had heard about seemed to be offered. Check-in was at a normal front desk. There are seated desk areas across from the main front desk, which I assumed were for the concierge, but I guess could have been used for seated check-in in the past. As far as things like cool towels and welcome drinks, I simply think this was done away with at some point. I didn\u2019t see anyone getting anything like this, although there was at least good fruit-infused water available next to the front desk.We ultimately got a call that our room was ready later in the afternoon, and came back to check-in around 7:00 pm. At that point, the lobby was pretty dead and we were able to check in very quickly and easily. Again, the front desk staff was fine, just not overly warm. In just a minute or two, we were off to our room and told that our luggage would follow soon behind. A friendly bellhop did bring the luggage up just a minute or two after we made it to the room. Our room on the second floor was easily accessible via the historic elevators right in the lobby. We found that elevators were practically always waiting right there for us whether we were leaving our room or going back up to it, which was nice.We really liked that the rooms in the historic building have beautiful carved wood doors, but even better was opening the door and realizing that we had been given a great upgrade. Rather than getting the grove garden view that we had been expecting, we had been upgraded by a couple of room categories to an Ocean View junior suite! If we had paid for this room upgrade, it would have been at least $200 more per night, so I definitely appreciated getting it for free. We also found a piece of the hotel\u2019s signature coconut cake as a birthday treat awaiting our arrival, along with the nice bag of mini banana muffins that comes standard in all rooms on check-in day. I was so impressed by how nicely we were treated after simply mentioning we were celebrating birthdays while there.We found the ocean view junior suite to be quite nice. It had plenty of space for the two of us to spread out, which was particularly nice because we had been expecting a very tiny room. I know the layout of rooms here can vary, but our junior suite was essentially an extra large hotel room, with the bed and desk right there when we entered the room, and a living room beyond that, one step up with frosted glass doors that could slide shut to make it feel like a totally separate room if so desired. It was nice to have a full living area with a couch, two chairs with a table, a coffee table, and a second TV.We found the d\u00e9cor to be very nice and tasteful. The feel of the room definitely reflected the hotel overall, with a sort of upscale classic look with dark wood and lots of pink and brown. The pink wallpaper on the wall behind the bed was really nice, and the bed was comfortable with upscale Frette linens. Another fun touch was the iPad included in the room with hotel information on it. It was fun to play around with the iPad, and I definitely learned more about what the hotel had to offer because the information was presented on an iPad, rather than in a traditional binder.Even with having a junior suite, the bathroom was still very tiny. It was the kind of bathroom where there\u2019s no way two people can fit in it at the same time, and you have to move around very gingerly to avoid banging into other things. However, I will say that the bathroom was nicely appointed, despite its small size. Everything was done in a nice brown marble, with good toiletries and a walk-in shower that was actually a generous size despite the bathroom feeling small overall. The only thing that was a problem was how absolutely tiny the sink area was. There was just no space for having toiletries or anything else out on the counter. However, a big treat in the bathroom was the Frette towels, which were so lovely and thick, exactly what you hope for in a luxury hotel.The ocean view from our room was really nice. We were on the second floor of the historic building, pretty much right above the Mai Tai Bar. Our room stuck out a bit so we had windows on two sides, looking out at the beautiful beach and ocean, as well as at the main oceanfront lawn area outside the lobby. We were even treated to the best seats in the house for the weekly luau on the night we checked in! The Royal Hawaiian has a very expensive luau (I believe $179 per person) on Monday nights on the lawn, and we basically had front row seats for the show from our window, which we opened to hear the music. We really enjoyed having a chance to watch the luau, and just hearing the music from the luau or the Mai Tai Bar with the windows open created a great \u201cHawaii\u201d feeling. We were a little worried about noise from the Mai Tai Bar carrying into the room, since we could hear it a bit when we in the room at night. However, we must have just been tired, or the noise must not have really carried from the windows in the living area to the bed, because it never interrupted our sleep at all.Overall, I was really quite happy with the rooms. It had a nice d\u00e9cor, and having a junior suite was a great source of extra space that we appreciated. There were only a couple of small negatives.  The bed area in the room was very dark. This probably wouldn\u2019t be a problem in most rooms. However, since all of our windows were on the far end in the living room, and there was no natural light coming directly into the bed area, it often felt too dark by the bed (both day and night). Also, it\u2019s probably to be expected in such an old building, but I had trouble finding convenient outlets to plug things into overnight to charge. There were also just a couple of little things missing here or there, which housekeeping should be trained to look for. For example, our room was missing simple things like a pen and paper, a \u2018do not disturb\u2019 sign, and a second of the pink and white striped robes. I also thought nightly turndown service would have been standard here, but it wasn\u2019t.  None of these were a big deal, and they definitely didn\u2019t really affect our stay. However, at a luxury property, attention to these little details is still important.There are a couple of other things to note about the historic building in particular. The way the building is set up, it has some pretty long hallways. Our room was a bit of a hike to the elevator, which was no big deal to us and allowed us to be on a quieter end of the floor. However, it could be a problem for anyone with limited mobility. The same goes for getting out to the pool and beach. It\u2019s a decently long walk down the pretty outdoor walkway from the historic building.  It\u2019s not really all that far, but could be difficult for some. We noticed down our hallway that there was a \u201cbathers\u2019 elevator\u201d for those going straight to the beach. It\u2019s not really something you\u2019d know about unless you wander around for it, or happen to have a room that\u2019s near it. It\u2019s a good idea in theory, and drops you off just slightly closer to the outdoor walkway to the pool and beach, I guess for the purpose of avoiding going through any part of the lobby in a wet bathing suit. However, despite being a good idea, it grossed us out when we took it. The elevator was really old (not in a charming historic way like the main elevators, but in a dated way), and it smelled horrible.Overall, I did leave the hotel with a generally favorable impression of the staff, although I think the consistency of service could go up just a little bit. As I mentioned before, the front desk staff was just ok, and the beach staff was a mixed bag, but some of the staff elsewhere was actually quite excellent. I was really impressed one time when the housekeeper, who was down the hall at the time, saw us leaving our room and addressed me by name to say hello when we walked by. The valet staff was also quite good. We were a bit of a pain with parking our rental car, since we ended up having to take out the car multiple times in a short period of time on a couple of occasions. We definitely used the in/out privileges more than most. Especially since moving the cars is a pain here, with the garage being past the Sheraton, the valet guys were always very nice, could always be seen running for cars, and had our car ready and waiting right away every time we called down. We had a convertible, and they were happy to put the top up or down for us. In addition, I was impressed that they learned my name and recognized me pretty quickly, even though we were only there for two nights.One thing that\u2019s definitely important to mention is the hotel\u2019s resort fee. It\u2019s not at all uncommon to find one at a resort hotel, but of course it\u2019s always annoying to have to pay an extra fee on top of an already expensive room rate. The fee is pretty high here, at $36 per night, and I really don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re getting much for it at the Royal Hawaiian. The resort fee includes valet parking and wifi in the room, along with really nothing else of value. I looked at the list of inclusions with the resort fee, and most of them seemed to be vaguely defined activities and tours around the hotel, with no information provided regarding when or where those occur. I also noticed that the resort fee is supposed to include a portrait session and free 4x8 photo to go with it. This isn\u2019t really something that I would have wanted to take lots of time out of our trip to do, but if it were easy, we would have. This was another thing where information on how to do it was conveniently not provided. With such a high resort fee, I really think there should be clearly spelled out information upon check-in so guests know how to actually make use of all of the inclusions and get value out of the resort fee.The main complaint regarding the resort fee, which I\u2019ve seen in many other TripAdvisor reviews, is that it\u2019s ridiculous for beach chairs and umbrellas to be an additional fee on top of the resort fee. I tend to agree with this. I\u2019ve been to plenty of hotels that charged a resort fee, but did not charge for beach chairs, and I\u2019ve been to plenty of hotels that charged for beach chairs but did not have a resort fee. It\u2019s usually one or the other. However, Royal Hawaiian was the first place I\u2019ve visited that charged for both, which is a bit exorbitant. We did end up reserving one of the beach sets (two chairs and an umbrella) for one of our days, and at $40 per day, it was definitely pricey. Since we reserved and paid for the beach chairs before we even left for our trip, it didn\u2019t end up bothering us that much, and we just resigned ourselves to the fact that it\u2019s just how it is by the time we got there. I will say that it was nice to know exactly where we\u2019d be sitting on the beach and not have to worry that all the chairs would be taken by the time we arrived. Since the beach in front of the Royal Hawaiian is technically open to the public, you could always bring your own beach chairs and avoid the fee by sitting in front of the Royal Hawaiian\u2019s chained off section. It just didn\u2019t seem worth it to us to do anything like that, and we were happy to have nicer lounge chairs with an umbrella in a quiet spot further back on the beach.I do recommend booking beach sets ahead of time. During our stay, there were plenty of beach sets available a week or two before arriving, which was when we booked ours online (you look at a map of the beach chairs and select exactly which ones you\u2019d like to reserve). However, on the day we went to the beach, many hotel guests were being turned away who hadn\u2019t pre-reserved chairs. The whole system actually seems kind of stupid to me. The beach sets are a flat $40 per day, which basically runs from 9-6 or so when the beach is open and staffed. However, it would be nice if there were an option to rent for just the morning or just the afternoon at a half rate. We rented our set for the day, knowing ahead of time that we\u2019d only be using it in the afternoon, and when we got there, it seemed that some people had done the opposite, leaving chairs vacated for the entire afternoon after having been there in the morning. I guess I appreciated that the beach staff didn\u2019t let guests who hadn\u2019t paid for chairs use them for free, but it also seemed silly to turn hotel guests away from using beach chairs when many were clearly vacated for the day as of mid-afternoon. However, since it\u2019s set up as a full day rental, you simply can\u2019t re-sell someone\u2019s chair that they\u2019ve paid for, just in case they come back. If it were set up with a half-day option, many more people would be able to use the beach and there wouldn\u2019t be problems with guests being turned away when chairs are vacant.The service on the beach was generally good, at least before they want to close for the day. You check in for your beach set at a desk at the beach entrance near the pool, and someone is happy to set up towels and make sure the umbrella is in the perfect position. Each chair had a plastic red flag on the back, and I liked the system of raising one\u2019s flag whenever you needed something. We were taken care of within 5 minutes when we raised our flag to order iced tea, a response time that I imagine could have been much longer without such a system. Note that there is no alcohol served on the beach. You can go to the bar that\u2019s right next to the beach, but you can\u2019t have alcohol onto the beach. For anyone who was expecting a refreshing tropical cocktail while lying on Waikiki Beach, it\u2019s not going to happen here.We enjoyed our time at the beach at the Royal Hawaiian. It was relaxing, and the beach set was definitely worth having to feel like we had our own nice space in a very busy section of Waikiki Beach. Other than the cost, the only thing we really didn\u2019t like was the way the beach chairs are taken down and the beach service is closed at the end of the day. We knew that beach service extended until 6:00 pm, and since we had only been at the beach in the afternoon, we wanted to stay until closing on a lovely day. Most other people did leave sooner, and the beach staff started taking down the chairs and umbrellas probably around 4:30-5:00 if it looked like a group had left for the day. This didn\u2019t really bother us, but what did bother us were the constant reminders to let us know that the beach service was going to be closing. From around 4:30 onward (a full 90 minutes before closing), we were reminded over and over that the beach was closing at 6:00, and it really felt like we were being pressured to leave early. We were asked at one point if we were willing to give up our umbrella early so they could take it down, to which we said no. We had paid for the umbrella until 6:00, so I found it annoying to be asked to give up what we had paid for early because the staff felt didn\u2019t feel like waiting. We did end up staying until just before 6:00, at which point we were the last group in the Royal Hawaiian\u2019s section on the beach (I was surprised how early everyone leaves the beach here). The staff was really hovering at that point, which just made it uncomfortable and awkward. We felt like we were being forced off the beach by our own hotel\u2019s staff, when we had every right to be there until 6:00. It was clear the staff was hoping to go home early, but I think the needs of the guests should come first.The Royal Hawaiian pool and hot tub also close at 6:00, but we were told we could use the pool if we wanted to after it had closed (the hot tub jets were turned off at 6:00). At that point, it was really nice to have the pool to ourselves. It was really nicely heated as well, which was perfect in March when the ocean temperatures were a little chillier than we\u2019d like.  At other times of day, I\u2019m sure the pool would definitely feel less adequate. It\u2019s a very small circular pool just in front of the tower building by the beach. The limited number of lounge chairs by the pool are available free of charge, but the cabanas around the pool are not. They\u2019re pricey. I think some people overblow the pool as an issue. It is really a tiny pool, but it\u2019s in a nice setting, and nice to be able to go back and forth from the beach to jump in. For a couple of adults who were just looking to use the pool for a quick chance to cool off, it was adequate.Plus, there is a secondary pool option over by the Sheraton. The Helumoa Playground is a shared pool complex positioned between the Sheraton and Royal Hawaiian for the use of both hotels\u2019 guests (it\u2019s located on the complete opposite side of the hotel from the main Royal Hawaiian pool). It\u2019s much larger and definitely a more family-friendly fun pool to use. We didn\u2019t go in it, but I did walk down to check it out, and it\u2019s large, with waterfalls and a slide that looked very fun. I did notice just from putting my foot in the water that the Helumoa pool was considerably cooler than the water in the Royal Hawaiian pool at the time. It also had a busier feel and many more kids around. Although that pool has a lot more chair space overall than the Royal Hawaiian pool, I\u2019m not sure how easy it is to find space there since it\u2019s shared between two hotels. Regardless, it\u2019s good to know that there are two pool options at the Royal Hawaiian, and I don\u2019t think the pool situation should keep anyone from staying there.As far as dining, we didn\u2019t eat any meals at the hotel. The oceanfront restaurant looked nice, but the prices were outrageous. Seeing that a waffle for breakfast was $21 was enough to make us go elsewhere. I\u2019m not even sure how many restaurants there are at the hotel. I know that Azure serves dinner and the Surf Lanai serves breakfast and lunch, but from what I could tell, they were essentially the same place. The only possible distinction I could draw was that Azure might be the indoor seating while the Surf Lanai could be the outdoor seating right in front of it. I really couldn\u2019t tell.We did stop at the Mai Tai Bar one night, somewhat out of a feeling of duty to try one of the famous Royal Hawaiian Mai Tais. The outdoor bar is nice and casual, with live music every evening, and plenty of tables so everyone can easily find somewhere to sit. We had a nice table overlooking the beach and found that the service was quite attentive, especially given how busy it was with people coming and going. The Mai Tais were quite large and were the best ones we had in Hawaii (although it\u2019s hard for us to judge, since we\u2019re not actually big Mai Tai fans). Combined with a dessert off of their menu (which does include everything from appetizers to full dinner entrees), it was a nice time and well worth it for an enjoyable end to our evening. I thought I had read somewhere in the past that one Mai Tai per person at the Mai Tai Bar was included as part of the resort fee. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just totally dreaming that up, but if it ever was part of it, it\u2019s no longer the case as far as we could tell.We explored a few other nearby hotels and concluded that the only places we\u2019d consider in the future are the Royal Hawaiian, the Halekulani, and the Moana Surfrider. Moana Surfrider is technically a Westin hotel, which, like the Royal Hawaiian, is part of Starwood. Just like the Royal Hawaiian, it is historic and pretty, in a great location just two hotels down from the Royal Hawaiian on Kalakaua Avenue, right on the beach. The Halekulani seems like it\u2019s typically cost prohibitive, with very high room rates relative to the Royal Hawaiian. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a nicer hotel, but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be willing to pay all that much more to stay there versus the Royal Hawaiian.All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Royal Hawaiian. The hotel is lovely, and it feels like stepping back in time to an era when traveling to Hawaii was a fancy event that warrants only the best in luxury accommodations. It\u2019s a legendary hotel for a reason. Its rooms are lovely, its location is perfect, and its distinctive pink theme is captivating. The location could not be better in Waikiki, both for going to the beach and walking to other hotels and restaurants nearby. We were really impressed with the great upgrade we were given to a junior suite in the historic building. It\u2019s definitely a busy hotel, with lots of guests and tourists coming through at all times. I think the level of service is generally pretty good given this fact, although other luxury hotels are a bit better overall in terms of service. We found the service to either be great (such as the valet staff), or just ok (front desk and beach). A little more consistency there would make it just about perfect, but even without that, we loved the hotel and would definitely come back in the future. Definitely don\u2019t forgo the unique opportunity to stay here over a more generic hotel in Waikiki instead."

        "review_text": "Me and my husband have stayed at this hotel over 5 times and is always our first choice as it is in the heart of Waikiki, right on the beach and close to all restaurants. This year we took our 2 year old daughter with us as a last family holiday before our new baby arrives. We paid for the room in full but the hotel also reserved the whole room amount again. We went to another part of the island for a few nights and then returned to the Outrigger for our final couple of nights before coming home. As the hotel had still reserved the full rate of the room we had already paid in full the first time our credit card that we left at the desk did not have enough funds. The manager came up to our room and asked us for full payment and if we were unable to pay we were to leave immediately. I was 6 months pregnant and with a 2 year old with no where to go and did not know where the money out of my account had gone. I asked the manager if he could just give me 30 mins to try and sort something out. I phoned my bank and they informed me that the Outrigger had my money on reserve which meant I could not access my funds until they released it from our first stay. I informed the manager who apologised by giving us a box of cookies and said that this error has happened before due to an in-house computer glitch. Firstly, why did he not check this before demanding we leave the premises and secondly a box of cookies did not make up for the way we were treated which ruined our whole holiday we saved up for years for. Very disappointing and unprofessional."

        "review_text": "We originally had reservations at Hay Adams for a portion of my husband's 40th birthday trip to DC, but impulsively changed them to stay at The Jefferson based on it's ranking on TripAdvisor and recommendation by Conde Nast.  We were also happy to be able to use our Amex FHR benefits and redeem a complimentary third night as advertised by Amex and on The Jefferson's website.Some highlights of our stay:- Valet and bell staff is second to none.  Gracious, respectful, accommodating.  We did not take advantage of the house car because we simply wanted to be out walking and enjoying the springtime weather, but it was offered.- The decor in the entire property is splendid.  Traditional and historic, but with fresh, modern touches everywhere.  The rooms are small and you will be dancing around the doors, furniture, and each other, but we were there to explore the city, not the inside of our room, so it was no matter to us.- The shower is glorious and the in-mirror tv is whimsical and novel.- Boone in The Greenhouse is a treasure.  He was not once our server but always greeted us by name when we came to the restaurant each morning and he was a pleasure to chat with (wish our actual server - same one each time - could've been as charming and kind but he was very stoic and cold).- Lovely breakfast food (you will sell your soul for their croissants) in The Greenhouse (miserable, bitter, thin coffee though).Where it went awry:- Egregious housekeeping.  Empty glass water decanters left on our desk the entire stay. Our used water glasses were removed (and not replaced) but the used water-ringed paper coasters were left on the desk, again the entire stay.  We asked for new water and glasses; they were delivered to our room and put on the dresser behind the tv, which we didn't discover until we were packing up to leave two days later.  Shower drain remained covered with hair the entire stay, and toiletries were not replenished even though obviously depleted.- Turn down service did not make it to ours and the neighbor's rooms until 8:45pm each night.  Traveling with our son who was already in bed at the time, we did not get to experience this amenity.- Maintenance/renovation issues.  There was a pen mark on the wall underneath the bathroom mirror; my educated guess is this is from marking a stud location when the tv mirror combo was installed.  Green wall paint was slopped onto the door casing in the bathroom in two spots.  Towel hook was precariously coming out of the wall.  Wall paint in the bedroom had been rolled onto the upholstered cornice over the bed.  Most of these things would take the engineering staff 5 minutes to fix and we couldn't believe those things have been overlooked all the time.- Questionable family friendliness.  We were traveling with our young son (8) and he was barely spoken to by ANY of the staff during our entire stay.  He was not greeted with the red wagon to pick a toy, no robe or cookies and milk as other reviews have spoken of.  The only time anyone reached out to him was literally as we were checking out, when the front desk staffer asked if he'd met Monty.  We hadn't, so they brought him up and it was a great experience.- Lastly, our complimentary third night was not honored at check out even though it was clearly stated on our travel agreement and had no exclusions.Overall it was a pleasant enough stay, but it certainly wasn't the experience we were hoping for.  We had to ask for too many things rather than the staff anticipating our basic needs, and the staff runs hot and cold.  During the same trip to DC we moved to another luxury hotel in a different neighborhood in town and the service, amenities, and property completely eclipsed our experience at The Jefferson (which reassured us it was not our unreasonable expectations that ultimately let us down).I did reach out to David Bueno, hotel manager, who replied in kind and remedied our billing situation.  I do hope some of these issues can be resolved before to consider staying at The Jefferson in the future."

The resort is actually on the strip but a little ways down past the luxor. We stayed in the one bedroom unit with the full kitchen. the pool here is absolutely fabulous and huge in size. The staff was helpful in many aspects and told us the shuttle left every half hour. Got to love the happy hr, if you drink cant beat it. We will stay here again and would recommend it to our friends"

        "review_text": "I love this place. Stayed five nights. My room was spacious and well designed. Comfortable bed. Nice flat screen. Decent art on the wall. Funky lighting. No tea maker or kettle but they did have an Illy coffee maker which was great but as I don't drink coffee, useless to me! I'm sure there was a hot water function but I couldn't work it out. Sound insulation between rooms is great. Didn't hear a thing from the adjacent rooms. Decent, friendly bar downstairs. Location is good too. Immediately south of market. Good for shopping and eating and close enough to landmarks.Got to shout out the excellent staff and Carolyn and Kristin at front desk in particular. They couldn't have been more helpful and friendly."

        "review_text": "Ok let's start with the good stuff. This hotel is excellent value for money! It's basically a luxury apartment with a large bedroom, kitchen, living area, complete with two wide screen TVs, a washing machine and drier and access to a swimming pool. Located about a mile and a half from the strip there is also a complimentary bus service which even collects from town up until 11.A very good choice then but one that comes with a HUGE word of warning. DO NOT by any means get roped into their Timeshare pitch!! I cannot stress this enough!! Whenever you check in you will be directed to the concierge who will present you with a welcome pack. She is very friendly and accommodating, but PLEASE, under no circumstances, agree to attend their Timeshare meeting, regardless of what gifts they may offer you. We lost 90 minutes of our holiday listening to a hardline sales pitch all for the price of a free dinner (poor quality in Planet Hollywood) and tickets to a show we already had free passes to. To top it all off they took $25 off our credit card for not agreeing to part with obscene amounts of cash in order to but Vacation points!I'll just stress again that this is the reason for my average scoring! The hotel was comfortable, fantastic value, relaxing and well positioned away from the mayhem of the strip. Just please, for your holiday's sake SAY NO TO THEIR TIMESHARE MEETING!!!!!"

We were showed around the hotel by 8pm or so we were told all restaurants are closed and the one that is open you have to be dressed up for and that was with loaded sarcasm and this was the end of our hotel tour, then we were showed our room. We were sure we did not book a pool view room and the staff tried to convince us it is an ocean front room - this room had all other rooms in the hotel looking straight into it. When we tried to rectify the problem we were showed a well smaller room with smaller beds which the staff knew we could not take as we had our young daughter with us. I cannot believe the reviews about the service - It must be made up. The hotel lifts and hallway are dirty, lots of stains - when we got out of the lifts we were invited with road noise - the trip was important to us as a family and we feel deceived that we were paying a high price for something of so much less value."

        "review_text": "I stayed in the Presidential Suite during spring break 2016 and it was nothing short of depressing:- they listed a bunch of amenities at check in (free massage, daily cabana by the beach, preferential seating at Plumeria, $100 laundry credit, etc.)- on check in, no welcoming by anyone (fine)- day one, all the cabanas were taken (so that afternoon, we chose the one we want for the rest of the week)- day two, cabana was there- day three, I went and dropped my stuff at the cabana, then had breakfast.  On return, someone else was sitting there, and my stuff was gone!  My friend went over to the little kiosk and some attendant say \"hmmm, your name was crossed out\" (probably someone took a tip and decided it was easy to just remove a name from the list).  When I went to the kiosk to ask for my lost bad, the guy said \"oh, we have it here\" - so they removed my bag, then gave the cabana I reserved to someone else.  When I ask the guy to fix it, he gave me royal face like I WAS THE ONE AT FAULT.- about the \"preferred seating at Plumeria\" - forget it!  I called down to get a table, and 3 out of 4 days they weren't even ready.Get ready for the worst part - when I went to check out, my massage was on the invoice, the laundry was on the list, etc.  You have ask for them to remove it.  This is NOT a mistake, because my friend HAD THE SAME ISSUE!  So please don't respond and say this was an isolated incidence.  It's not.No thanks.  I can spend $3,500 a night and get much better service.BUYERS BE WARE.  CHECK YOUR BILL!!!!"

        "review_text": "We took 2 suites for our family for a 10 day stay at exorbitant prices - a junior suite for the children and a diamond head suite for ourselves -  and had a highly disappointing stay. If you are looking for a luxury resort with personal service and attention to detail, please do look elsewhere. I would also be very wary of the flattering reviews in this board - they bear no resemblance to the experience we had during our stay. We would have moved out if we could but the hotel insisted we pre-pay the entire bill before arriving due to the 'peak season.'The hotel is crowded (with mainly Japanese tourists), high-density with impersonal, perfunctory service. We stayed for 10 days but no one took the trouble to remember you or greet you or even smile at you (not the reception, concierge, waiters). Breakfast at Orchids is an obstacle course - before being seated you not only have to inform them of your room number but also spell out your name (first and surname) while they look you up often without success on a computer. When there is a queue the whole process takes ages. It felt like an economy class check in every morning just to get breakfast.One morning it took us a whole hour to get food/breakfast on the table at Orchids - 20 mins to wait for a table, 20 mins to find someone to take your order, and another 20 mins for the food to arrive. And this was when the restaurant was half-empty. The place just does not have enough wait staff to cope with the work load and the staff are not at all well trained.The breakfast at the buffet style alternative (House Without A Key)  is even worse - long queues at the buffet, tables placed close together which isnt pleasant when you have wailing babies at the next table as we did on our first morning. There is no question of a relaxing breakfast or friendly personal service from wait staff that you get at other proper luxury resorts.Sleep quality - the beds are not good quality and the mattress dips in the middle. Pillows are not comfortable either. The rooms do not have blinds or curtains - only plantation shutters that let in the light - so without eye shades there is no question of sleeping in after 6 or 7am if you wanted to.Housekeeping is perfunctory. Two main lights in our suite's sitting room were not working when we checked in (rendering the room half dim at night) and were still out 5 days later when we finally asked them to fix them. Noone bothered to check before or after we checked in. The maids turn down service has this peculiar habit of turning ON the giant plasma TV in the bedroom and some strange night light under the nightstands, so if you are returning late to your room you have to hunt high and low for controls to switch them off before retiring. The night light defers all logic and is not connected to any master or other switch that a mortal being can find.The concierge is patchy and staff changes every day. We did get a couple of good restaurant recommendations; otherwise the concierge is only fair and at times bad. A request to book dinner at a casual sports bar nearby was met with \"it should be fine for you to walk in\". We did and had to wait 30 mins in the rain for a table. All because our concierge couldnt be bothered to make a phone call.One concierge sent us to a truly awful polynesian/magic show at the Holiday Inn with cafeteria style seating, inedible food and an Elvis impersonator/singer. I just could not believe the concierge of a luxury hotel would think their guests would enjoy this. There is no question that the concierge can get priority tables at popular places for guests as they do in proper luxury hotels - our booking for Alan Wong was only obtained after 8 days. Our request for tickets to the Jurassic-Kualoa (made the day we arrived) was unsuccessful - in the end a friendly chauffeur with good contacts managed to get us tickets but NOT the hotel concierge.The hotel beach is tiny, almost non-existent. The pool is small too and again the service there is perfunctory. There is nowhere pleasant to hang out to have a drink or dessert after 10pm - the restaurants and poolside shuts down after 1015pm and the lounge provided for evening drinks is a claustrophobic place (no view or windows) with very few tables. There are 6 tables in a paviilion facing the courtyard (not the sea/pool) for evening drinks but they are often full and service is achingly slow.Halekulani is not a luxury hotel and is poor value for money - it is too high density, and the service is at best fair at worst poor. In the Christmas season when we stayed, the place is teeming with hundreds of Japanese tourists and often feels almost like an Asian conference centre rather than a luxury resort. If you're looking for a pampering relaxing stay, opt for the Kahala (which I really wish we had) or one of the other islands."

Consistency in the quality of the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9 was never there despite staff attempts to offer it for free to make it up for a previous bad quality one (I was once served a burnt out cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9).2. I made it clear at check-in that I don't want to be charged for incidentals as I won't be consuming any extras. I therefore paid for the room and taxes, and paid for anything else on spot. Reason being here is that I travel with a debit card and a blocked amount would take forever to be credited back to the account. I was charged anyways and I only noticed that when I got back home. I send an email to the person I have been liasing too, and no response. If I haven't called, no one would have cared. I did call and the response was that they will contact the bank and try to release the amount.3. The hotel of course is not all bad, but service and quality of food is way too far from being consistent. I also can't explain neither justify not responding to returning customers' emails. Very frustrating and disappointing."

We requested  to change our room and the next day they were nice enough to change our room. We were so happy with the new one even disappointed that we couldn't stay another night . Bed was very comfortable. Good size room are nicely decorated.  Good location. Close to all the shops."

I was quite disappointed with the service, and had quite a few issues with the room itself. For instances, the bathrooms were not clean. It is clear to me that this hotel did not stand up to its perceived value. A true waste! Next time I will stay elsewhere."

It turned out to be a disaster for me, and probably every guest who could not get out of the hotel. It was among the worst breakfasts I ever had in life."

        "review_text": "I stayed at this hotel in late July 2017. This was my 3rd trip here because of the great Waikiki location on Kaiulani Avenue at Kuhio Avenue. The furniture is slightly old and could use an updating but the room itself was very clean, neat and quiet. Also, every employee I met from the 5th floor maids to the bellboys to the front desk personnel were all very nice and engaging.I returned to this large (441 rooms over 19 floors) hotel because it is a great value in Waikiki. The only problem is that the room rates quoted don't include all the different taxes and what the Outrigger calls a \"Resort Fee\" of $15.00/night for each room. If this fee is constant for every room for every night then it should just be included in the room rate and not added on separately.I arrived at the Honolulu airport on a Hawaiian Airlines flight at 11:30 am and was in my hotel room at 1:00 pm. The hotel has a stated check-in time of 3:00 pm but will let you in early if your room type, I counted 39, is available early and mine was. I took a SpeediShuttle van from the airport and was met in baggage claim and then got in a shuttle with 6 other people and we stopped at 4 different hotels before finally arriving at the Ohana East. The van ride was very nice, informative and a good value ($9.00 not including tip - make reservations online before leaving home) with a taxi from the airport probably $35.00 - $40.00.I enjoyed my 10 night stay in this hotel. The rooms were clean, the employees were nice and the cost, while high, was good for Waikiki. The hotel has a pool, fitness area, on-site parking ($30), 2 PC's in the lobby to check e-mails and a self-service laundry on the ground floor. Once in Waikiki there is no need to rent a car because everything is within walking distance of the hotel and \"TheBus\" only costs $2.50 per person for a ride of any distance even around the entire island of Oahu and numerous bus lines conveniently run up and down Kuhio Avenue next to the hotel.There are currently 2 restaurants and a third being remodeled. The only Waikiki grocery store (Food Pantry) is located across the street as is an ABC Store. The newly remodeled International Market Place with all its' specialty stores is also in the same block and the beach is only about 10 minutes away.I have recommended and will continue to recommend this hotel to others. The location in central Waikiki and the clean rooms makes this a good choice for tourists looking for a good value in Hawaii."

        "review_text": "We are always trying new hotels in Bangkok, so I thought we would give this one a go.    It looked good on-line and I thought was actually cheap for what was expected.I requested transport, a car to collect us from the airport.  The hotel emailed me back with a small schedule of prices.   I requested the Mercedes and advised of our flight number.  There was 6 hours between the time it was requested and the time we needed it.   Arriving at the airport there was nobody to meet us.  I checked the email and the hotel had not confirmed the car booking, so we took an airport limo instead.  No big deal at the time\u2026 their loss anyway.Arriving at the hotel it smelled very new, just renovated - Nice!   I didn\u2019t mention the car not turning up.    We went to our room\u2026  upon entry we noticed the table-top with a fair amount of rice and drinking glass rings from the previous guests\u2026. and the floor was sticky and we could see footprints.  I asked the concierge if the room had been cleaned at all, he could see the mess and he run to get the cleaners.   We just went out and asked them to do it properly.   It was okay when we got back.Nice bed and sheets we turned in for the night\u2026. I put the air-con on the lowest setting\u2026 it went down to 18 or 19 I think from memory, but we were still hot.  We both couldn\u2019t sleep as the room temperature remained at what felt about 24 degrees throughout the night.  I was dipping sweat.   We didn\u2019t bother to complain because the hotel was cheap, and nice and new and only the one night for us anyway.On checkout there were what seemed like Managers at the desk, they were asking about our stay.  We were still upbeat and happy, heading off to start a long holiday.  We said the hotel is nice but mentioned the car not showing up, and the hot room\u2026 but I didn\u2019t mention the rice not wanting to sound like we whinge abut everything.  Kitty was his name and he gave me a nice travel adapter as a gift and apologised for the faults.  He seemed so eager to please us and asked if we are coming back through - so I told him yes we will be in Bangkok again in 3 weeks.   He said \u201cPlease let me offer you a free room upgrade when you return\u201d - I accepted.We then received an email from Pinyapat Panaraj Front Desk Manager who might have been there with Kitty.  She mentioned the problems we had in a cut-and-paste email, I could tell it was a template apology because of the different size fonts.   True to my word I booked again at the Solitaire.We again emailed ahead and asked for the Hotel car and advised of flight numbers. I sent it to two different address including Pinyapat and said \u201cdon\u2019t forget to pick us up this time!\u201d.    On arrival at the airport again they were not there, and had not confirmed despite this time having 2 days to arrange it.    We again took a Limousine Of Thailand.Arrival at the hotel at 8:30pm I asked for Kitty so I could redeem the room upgrade.  He was not there - so I asked for the manager, and the front desk girl who could not speak much English said \u201cmanager finish already at 6:00pm\u201d.  So I asked any duty manager?  \u201cNo\u2026\u201d  I asked who is managing the hotel at the moment - and she just looked at me.   Nobody.  Clearly here are some reasons for the mayhem.   I mentioned the promise for the upgrade and she cheerily sang \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know about that story\u201d.I was now really angry and went to my room and emailed the people involved.    Now three days later and nobody has replied to my emails.In the morning we tried getting an elevator that were SO full of people, low social-economic type people that were smelly and loud!   We surrendered lift-cars twice not wanting to share with the smell and noise, but ended up cramming in - Phew!!!   I have since read reviews about packs of Indian and Chinese folk staying here, and I now know exactly what that reviewer was talking about.    I think the cheap price of this hotel attracts cheap people.   The lobby was full of these people\u2026 there were so many smoking all around the hotel entrance, their cars parked blocking the hotel Tuk Tuk in\u2026 parked two abreast right across the hotel entrance.  I asked the concierge to tell them to move, but they looked to afraid.   We had to wait 10 minutes for the smoke and people to clear before getting out of there.I have since sent all this information to the General Manager just earlier today, but so far no reply.Being a Level 6 Luxury Hotel Specialist and level 25 Hotel Specialist Contributor with a leading number of 'Helpful' votes (Now called Thumb\u2019s up) \u2026you might imagine I put a lot of time into helping fellow travelers by writing detailed and honest reviews. I get paid Nothing.. No rewards, No discounted accommodation, No points\u2026 nothing, just a mouse click from you. So if anything in the review is useful please let me know by clicking me a \u2018Thumbs Up to keep me going\u2019\u2026. thanks!"

        "review_text": "We stayed in two hotels during our stay in San Francisco and the Zetta was excellent.It's ideally located, close to Union Square, the BART station and the cable car turnaround on Powell. But it's far enough from the tourist hordes on the wharf areas that you can get a quiet night's sleep. Around the block there's a Nordstrom's Rack, Macy's and Bloomingdales, Blue Bottle Coffee, and more shopping.The king bed was dreamy and helped with a good night's sleep. Bathroom was spacious and had everything we needed - towels and bath products. Charging gadgets was easy with a lot of power outlets.Cavalieri, the restaurant within the hotel, serves tasty breakfast. We didn't get to try lunch or dinner but from the looks of it the food would've been great too."

        "review_text": "There aren't enough words to express how bad my experience was here - and of course it was on my honeymoon! Let me start off by saying I do not have picky taste.  My expectations were slightly higher than the rest seeing as there were many people who had amazing experiences here and I really do not know how.  The rooms were terribly out-dated and as soon as we pulled the sheets down there was hair ALL over! It gets better, I walk into the bathroom and there were ants just crawling around (mind you, I am from the city - this was bad!).  On top of it all when we had checked in my in-laws had purchased us a gift certificate and additional room upgrade.  They decided to tell us the gift certificate was our upgrade - thank GOODNESS we called our parents only to find out it was an addition.  They then decided to upgrade us to a suite because of what we had gone through (which was nothing special at all but a nice gesture) which I found to be funny because when we checked in they had \"no suites available.\" The only thing great about this hotel was their bellman, his name was Albert and SO beyond helpful I kept wondering why he was not the manager! This hotel was truly embarrassing! You don't have to trust me but I truly hope I can help some couples out who are considering this place.  I NEVER write a review if I have a bad experience because to each their own but this I felt was absolutely needed especially for the price you will pay!"

        "review_text": "The newly opened hotel is beautiful and Trump did not spare an expense in decor, BUT the service level so far has been very disappointing. Trump should have delayed its grand opening until the staff was better trained.The guest reception at my arrival and at the front desk was not great. My uber driver was 100% more friendly and welcoming. The hotel has Lots of staff around, but they don't seem to be trained to provide the service expected at a 5 star hotel yet.The hotel manager came to introduce himself to me once he saw the desk staff taking awhile to process my check in and gave me his card. When I called the number on his card later to provide feedback about a few service problems I encountered at dinner, I was charged $20 on my room bill for a \"long distance call\" to his cell number. CrazyThe trump attach\u00e9 (similar to concierge/butler) service all sounds great, but no one even answered the phone line when I needed help tonight. After a few minutes later it transferred to the operator who sounded very overwhelmed.I ordered soup from room service for dinner but it arrived without a spoon. It took about 10 minutes to get a spoon delivered while the soup got cold. Then the tv froze up while I was watching it during dinner. I have to note the soup was good and I was able to get the tv to work again after turning it on and off about 5 times, but it was a pain and ruined what I hoped would be a relaxing night.The lobby bar is gorgeous, but again, poor service. I sat down to get a drink in one section, but no one came by, so I moved across the grand atrium and finally had my order taken, but the drink took about 15 minutes to arrive. The guests that sat down after me received their drinks before me. It was a good drink though.It is 11:55pm now and the atrium lobby still has very loud music playing which can be heard in the guest rooms which all surround the lobby. Normally I would enjoy the music, but I have an early conference to attend tomorrow and was hoping to get some rest tonight.My overall opinion is that Trump over promised and under performed for $825 a night basic room rate. Next time I will stay at the St. Regis or Ritz, unless they really improve their Guest service standards."

        "review_text": "Please think twice about booking at this property - especially if you think you might check out early:I booked a reservation at this property using Hhonors Points (I'm a Hilton Honors Diamond Member).Our original reservation was for one week.  We checked in on a Saturday and after one night's stay decided to change to another Hampton Inn to be closer to our son who lives in North Las Vegas and was leaving for Afghanistan.On Saturday evening we called the Front Desk and informed them.  They said to just come down in the morning and a Hotel Manager would refund our unused points (6 nights).On Sunday morning we were informed (twice) by the Front Desk that a Hotel Manager was not on duty but they would give us a receipt for one night's stay and said our unused points would be refunded as soon as a Manager was back in the office on Monday.We checked out and moved to another Hampton Inn to be closer to our son.After one week there was no refund on my account so I called Hhonors (I had also left a voice message with the person who handles refunds at the Hotel).  Hhonors contacted the Hotel and the hotel responded that \"as a gesture of goodwill and one time exception, our office has refunded 50% requested for a refund.  For future reference, it is recommended the stay be amended prior to arrival when at all possible.\"I was quite flabbergasted as being a Hhonors member for over 10 years, this is the first time I have ever been charged for an early checkout.  It also contradicts what I was informed when I was on the property and inquired with the staff.I also find it at odds with the cancellation policy posted on the Hhonors website when making the reservation which reads \"No-shows or cancellations of Reward Stay Reservations outside of the time frame set by the hotel's individual cancellation policy will be charged one night's room and tax at the hotel's Best Available Rate for that date.Instead of charging me one night's room and tax, the Hotel pocketed 3 nights of my points ($189 room rate x 3 = $567).  HOW DISGUSTING!!I followed up with Hhonors one more time who contacted the Hotel again.  The Hotel's response this time was \"The hotel has advised us that they will not be refunding points for moving to another property.\"All I can say is BUYER BEWARE!!"

We were fortunate to receive an upgraded partial ocean view one bedroom suite on a high floor.  Partial ocean view meant a good ocean view not just a peek and we were delighted.  We love the quiet privacy and the beautiful rooms, the fully featured Toto automatic toilet, great well equipped kitchen and the views of course.  Housekeeping service twice a day is really appreciated.  We needed to have access to a computer, printer, and scan services for work and all were easily accessible at no charge.  Small but important things.  The bellmen were prompt with retrieving the car and the phones were always answered on the first ring.  We enjoyed the pool and the In Yo breakfast buffet.  Only a block from the beach and close to world class retail and restaurants, this place is hard to beat for location.  Waikiki is undergoing a tremendous transformation to a world class destination.  It's one of our family's favorite places to stay and we look forward to returning."

        "review_text": "I am very picky with hotels, which made travel to an expensive city like San Francisco a bit difficult. When I came across Hotel Zetta with great reviews and beautiful pictures, as well as a reasonable price, I thought it was too good to be true. Well, it was very true. We loved ever second of our 3-night stay.Before we arrived, I received an email with a link to the hotel's app. We were able to request extra towels and some toiletry items so they were waiting for us when we got there. Love this!It was raining in SF during our entire trip. We arrived via Uber and were greeted by doormen holding umbrellas. At check in, the front desk staff was friendly and conversational and even gave us a bottle of wine.We were given room 501, close to the elevator on the 5th floor and with a view of 5th St. The room was enormous! There was a large closet with full-length mirrored doors. The closet contained a safe and an iron. The bathroom was the size of some apartments. It had a large vanity with tons of storage, a huge shower, and the toilet slightly separated in a little alcove, where there was also more shelf storage. The bathroom lighting was good. The Neil George bath products were lovely.We had 2 queen beds that were incredibly comfortable with soft, high quality sheets. The desk area was very large and would be ideal for a business traveler. There were plenty of outlets around the room, which is often something I find lacking in hotels, and the clock on the nightstand included USB ports for even easier device charging.We used the standard free Wi-Fi in the room, and it was more than acceptable. I was able to stream Netflix with no problem.There was a small refrigerator with mini-bar items and a Nespresso machine.I loved being able to get quality coffee without leaving the room.We were not bothered by street noise at all. A few times we did hear people coming down the hallway, but it really wasn't an issue. The blinds & room darkening shades worked perfectly for sleeping.The hair dryer provided in the room broke, but reception was very quick to send up another when we called down. They also provided me an umbrella, gave us restaurant recommendations, and helped me to print my boarding pass. Really great service.We had drinks at the lobby bar and also ate at the attached Cavalier restaurant. Both were excellent with friendly & attentive service. Both were a bit pricey, though. We did not get a chance to check out the Playroom, since we were not there too long and it was frequently closed for private events.The d\u00e9cor of the room, bathroom, and common areas was funky & modern, with unique art and trendy style.The location was ideal. Since it was raining, we didn't walk around as much as we would have liked (mostly taking Uber), but there was a shopping mall basically right next door and a Bart station about a block away. We also found a food truck serving tasty breakfast smoothie bowls just down an alley from the hotel.I am eager to visit San Francisco again during better weather and will 100% be staying at Hotel Zetta again!"

        "review_text": "- Our family of four including 2 teenagers aged 17 & 19  travelled with Hawaiian Airlines from Sydney for a short break.- Chose Hawaiian Airlines for their generous baggage allowance .and  good rates. Service was great, seats a bit hard but tolerable.- Chose this hotel for it's value and proximity to transport, Waikiki beach and shops.All buses to Ala Moana, Pearl Harbour, Waikele Premium Outlets, Kahala shopping Mall, Diamod Head etc left from Kuhio Ave down the street from this hotel.- Had 2 connecting rooms 901 & 911 on the  second floor (smoking floor).but there was no smell of smoke in the hallways. Both rooms were very  clean each with 2 very comfortable double beds. had A/C's TV's, fridges, excellent WI FI reception (free), balconies and the rooms were attended to daily. The staff were very attentive, kind, well mannered and we can't thank them enough.The hospitality room with computers, TV and microwave and the laundry room next door were a blessing.The hotel arranged for our free transport from / to Airport.Did not get a chance to use the pool or visit the bar/grill restaurant. but had a walk through and all looked good.- We quite liked the Hawaiian themed d\u00e9cor of the rooms and our only suggestion would be to have smaller chest of drawers in the rooms  so as to allow more room for suitcases, save the money spent on fancy Bidet / Toilet seats and spend it on re-carpeting the hallways and install better lighting in the bathrooms.- The International Market Place due to open in 2016 is on Kushio St, but for the meantime there is a narrow alley way next door with plenty of stands selling Hawaiian T-shirts, dresses etc.- ABC  stores ( bread, milk, drinks, snacks, toiletries), and the Food Pantry were only a 2 minute walk away.- Ross For Less on Seaside Ave  a 5 minute walk (open till 1.00 A.M !) a great place to shop for clothes, shoes some household goods etc. We found more here than all of Ala Moana and the Outlet ( daughter found a magnificent evening gown, several day dresses, tops, Guess shoes very very cheap. Son found a Nike Sports jacket , some fancy shirts, and several items for 'mates'- Going to Waikele , catch the new \"E\" bus (instead of No 42,) change to No 433 at the Waipahu transit centre ( this will save you more than an hour of travel). Make sure you tell the \"E\" bus driver you are going to Waikele to get the one ticket for both buses .Found  quite a few 'brand ' name items at reasonable prices here. Son and husband found football and basketball shoes at Sports Authority and a designer watch all at good prices..McDonalds is across the road as is a great Party Shop.- Going to Pearl Harbour (plenty of reviews on this site) we joined a tour group which finished the tour early in the afternoon and instead of returning to Waikiki with the  tour bus we caught the bus from the highway across the road from Pearl Harbour to Pearl Ridge Shopping Mall .This place is in two sections  (Uptown and Downtown) There is a monorail $1.00 each way from inside the shopping centre that travels between the two sections. We found  quite a few things here at very good prices.- Visited the Flee Market on Sunday held at Aloha Stadium. Total waste of time. Hundreds of identical stands selling exactly the same Hawaiian T-shirts and very little else. Had  a massive headache from seeing the same things for over 2 hours of walking (only did half the stadium and gave up !) AND had to endure the family's ire for having dragged them out there !- Went to Paradise Cove (pre-arranged from Sydney) on New Year's Eve, had a great time, well worth seeing, were seated on the side tables, great view of the stage, good company and the activities before the show were great too. We got back in plenty of time to rest a bit at the Hotel and head to Waikiki Beach for fireworks display.- Went to Ala Moana a few times (plenty of other reviews on this site) . Walk straight through the food court, out on Keeamoku St, where you'll find Nordstrom, Wal-Mart and another Ross across the road.- Husband and son caught the No 19 bus to Toy Lynx on Iwileii Road  to purchase some \"rare\" Yu-Gi-Oh cards ! while daughter and I caught the No 22 bus, drove past Diamond Head and went to Kahala Shopping Mall. which had quite a few nice dress shops and eateries.- As for Waikiki beach, it is a 'paradise' for swimming, sunbaking or simply walking around at any time of day or night, plenty of eateries and expensive boutiques open till late. Denny's nearby has the most scrumptious milk shakes. The Cheese Cake Factory has  great food ( Don't spend hours in the queue, ask to be seated at the bar area (even with Children) and you will be served straight away. We also ate at the Atlantis Restaurant which had great service and wonderful food.- Hawaiian hospitality was evident everywhere we visited, such kind and happy people."

        "review_text": "I spent well over $700 for one night's stay and 90 minutes in the bar.  The hotel's decor is ludicrously over the top.  It's as though it's a Disney-imagined European setting for a spy movie.  So gaudy as to be repulsive.Worse, though, especially given the price of the room, is the smarmy service from the front desk to the concierge, to the bar's waitstaff.  They seem to have been trained to treat guests as not quite important or wealthy enough to be welcome there.  The front desk check-in was impersonal and snotty.  The bar experience was simply horrific.  Servers were absent for long periods, and when they did appear, they acted as though the last thing in the world they felt like doing was taking our order and bringing our drinks.I would love to have seem this significant historical location be transformed into a success story, but without a service makeover, this hotel will not make it.  I certainly won't stay here again."

        "review_text": "My stay here was terrible. Booked the main tower premier room. Was amazed by the grand lobby for the price we paid. My mistake was to ask for high floor rooms. In my entire trip of about 5 days in the hotel, coming in and out of the rooms for more than 4 times a day, I did not met a single person there. However, at night we always hear door banging sound. The rooms were big but lights are not shining enough into the room, making it spooky. My first night there was terrible as my friend saw something dirty and ask me not to see it. My whole 3 nights were terrible and I can't wait to leave the hotel everyday. Never wanting or plan to stay there again because of the experience. Maybe it's just my luck down or the room itself."

        "review_text": "Stayed for two nights in April. Room was okay; a little small for USA but I live in Asia not so bad for me. My room had nice view. Gym was good. Internet is free and fast. So far so good, right? Well.......Breakfast was only so-so in terms of taste and service was pretty slow. But the real shocker was my experience in the lobby bar at 9:00pm on a Friday night. A group of 6 young women entered the bar,  split up into pairs and started trying to flirt with and approach all of the guys in the bar. I was with my father who is 80 years old so we were left alone but the two guys seated next to us got approached three times in fifteen minutes; one very loud pair of girls was very persistent asking for room numbers and wanting to go upstairs \"to get high and get wild. After the two men talked to one girl for 2-3 minutes and rejected her suggestion to go upstairs together, she got angry and said they still had to pay her US $50 \"for taking up her time\"! About an hour later a different group of girls came in and did the same thing. I noted the bartenders seem to know the girls so I guess this is a regular occurrence (?). Worst of all when I got back to my room that night there was an envelope under my door addressed to me by first and last name containing 6 \"free\"drink tickets and complimentary entrance tickets for a nearby strip club.  The envelope and paper were official St Regis stationery. Clearly someone who was working in the bar or hotel is giving out stationery, room numbers and guest names to girls and sleazy places nearby. I was pretty shocked. When checking out the next morning I raised the issue with front desk staff. They looked embarrassed but said \"the bar is a public place\" and then wouldn't make eye contact. Pretty lousy performance by a brand a thought represented true class!"

The rooms were nice and clean and I loved the fact that they are all suites.  I am not  gambler or a smoker so this hotel was ideal didn't have to deal with he noises or the smells. It is not on the strip, but within walking distance, so I didn't need to be I  the action 24/7 but if you wanted to visit the strip you could be there in no time. Already looking forward to a return trip. Thanks Platinum."

        "review_text": "On Friday, December 29th at approximately 4:30 pm, I woke to three Nevada police officers and a Marriott representative knocking at my room door. The officer stated the bellman alerted the hotel that I had a Rifle and Pistol in the luggage that he brought to the room upon checking into the hotel\u2026. how is this possible when we checked in on December 23rd\u2026? and the officers are knocking at my door on the 29th\u2026 Needless to say, while in shock and disbelieve one of the officers questioned me while the other two officers searched our 2-bedroom villa. The officer questioned who I was with, what did my husband look like, what did my parents look like, what kind of car did we drive among a few other questions\u2026 thereafter the officer pulled out a picture from hotel security asking if I was the man in the photo\u2026. Obviously, I wasn\u2019t the guy in the photo but the officer insisted it did look like me\u2026 the guy in the photo was tall, looked like he was in his 50\u2019s and on the slimmer side\u2026 which wasn\u2019t even close to my description\u2026 The officers eventually called off their search and left after failing to find any firearms in my villa. Aside from saying we may have the wrong room\u2026 there was no explanation, no apology, nothing.This ordeal was extremely embarrassing. It was our last night in Vegas after having spent the Christmas holiday with my elderly parents.The Marriott representative whom I later found out was Susan Chaffer, Director of Security had a poker face the entire time. She said nothing during the whole ordeal and her cold demeanor along with the action of the officers made me feel like I was a criminal and yet I committed no crime or had any firearms in my possession.I called the hotel operator and was transferred Thelma Williams in their loss prevention department. I requested the names of the Marriott representative and the three Nevada Police Officers. Ms. Williams advised me that it was Susan Chaffer that accompanied the officers and she had left for the day.Ms. Williams further advised that only Ms. Chaffer would be able to provide the officers names and that she\u2019d have Ms. Chaffer call me when she returned to work. I requested the name and phone number of Ms. Chaffer\u2019s supervisor and Ms. Williams refused to provide that information; Ms. Williams stated information for Ms. Chaffer\u2019s supervisor would only be provided by Ms. Chaffer.Later that evening I received a call from Jonathan (I didn\u2019t get his last name). Jonathan stated that the officers were doing their job considering the recent shooting in October. He further stated the bellman said the guest name was \u201cJoseph\u201d and after their loss prevention completed a search in their hotel guest database, I was the only Joseph in the hotel at that time\u2026. This is a little hard to believe but okay\u2026 let\u2019s assume that is correct\u2026 if the bellman reported this to security, and the bellman took up the luggage\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t you think the bellman would know the exact room number that he took the luggage too??? and thus finding out the name of the guest for which he just delivered the luggage and suspected firearms???I told Jonathan, my only issue with the officers was the fact they accused me of looking like the man in the picture when clearly it wasn\u2019t even close. My issue is with the Marriott. The Marriott alerted the officers with false information, without facts. How do you subject your Marriott Vacation Club Owners to this kind of stress and embarrassment? I asked again for the names of the officers and was told Ms. Chaffer would call or email me the necessary information. Today is Thursday, January 5th and I still haven\u2019t received any such call or email\u2026We\u2019ve been Marriott Vacation Owners since 2007 and own multiple timeshare properties and vacation club points\u2026 Is this really what we should expect from Marriott\u2026 intimidation, harassment, embarrassment, and complete lack of regard for customer service?What if it was my elderly parents that were in the room at the time this occurred and was the recipients of this harassment? What if it was your ailing elderly parents, would this sit well with you? My parent\u2019s health is failing rapidly and as such we anticipated on staying at this hotel for our monthly visits as we have many times in the past\u2026 it looks like we need to find other lodging accommodations now.Friends and Colleagues are advising that we should seek legal advice for this harassment\u2026 is that what it takes these days??"

        "review_text": "Low key and quiet. Not just the hotel and casino, but distance from The Strip also added to the calm. Additionally, when our room became flooded from the room upstairs, this at about 5:30 AM, the staff responded quickly to the emergency, and also to our comfort. We were immediately given a new room, right down the hall, but becasue we had an ADA room, they acknowledged the new room did not meet our needs, and by 11 AM, way ahead of the expected time, we were given a new ADA room. Very good. Oh, and it is worth mentioning that our walk from our parked car to our room has been the SHORTEST of ANY hotel we have every stayed in while in Las Vegas"

A quick tour of the room was followed with a depressing \"Is there anything else I can help you with?\" My room had a nice view, but that's all I can really say about this property. When I opened the closet, I found a few bugs. I called down to the front desk to speak to the manger, Kenix, who was incredibly condescending and rude to me and did not take my concerns seriously.Fellow Tripadvisors, I cannot state this enough, ignore the good reviews of this hotel! It is incredibly dated and suited for older travelers or Japanese travelers (who they HEAVILY market this hotel to). If you are an American/Canadian/Australian traveler I would highly recommend to not stay here. Go try Trump, Westin, Four Seasons, honestly anything other than this hotel. Halekulani needs to find better, less snippy, racist, condescending employees who do not give a crap about their job. STAY ELSEWHERE, BUYER BEWARE"

The elevators are high-tech and took a minute to get used to -- you put your room number into a keypad outside the elevator, and there are no buttons inside.  There are seven elevators, but it often seemed like a longer wait because of the way the system puts everyone who's waiting into one elevator before another one opens, so it's probably more efficient, but sometimes frustrating.  The location is terrific -- right off Market Street, next to the Powell Street BART Station."

        "review_text": "The Jockey Club is a front for Saphire Resorts timeshare scammers. This property is an older rehabbed property that is used for scammers of timeshare sales. parts of the building look presentable while other parts are rundown and older looking. the access is through an ally that is a bit troubling for safety as well as smell. The biggest danger here is the timeshare people of Saphire Resorts. They lie, and try to get you to see a presentation for two hours. They wasted over three hours of our time, Not the 120 minutes they said. They lied repeatedly to us. They will promise show tickets, money for slot machines and food credit. The show tickets were able to be redeemed but the slot machine credit was a trick. It was only valid in a sleazy run down casino on \"special\" machines that do not pay out any winnings. I had the credit to over a thousand dollars but no pay out. The food credits are a scammer card that is buy one get one free or discounted at specific places not on the Las Vegas strip. They set us down four different times to hard sale closers to try to sell timeshares before allowing us to leave. They tell you repeatedly \"it is a one time offer\". we were finally given the Scammer \"gifts\", then just told there is the door to leave. They did not even show us the way out after bringing us in a different area. THAT IS STILL NOT THE WORST PART!  THEY SELL YOUR EMAIL AND PHONE NUMBER!!! We have been plagued by calls and emails ever since! don't ever go here or talk to these people!"

        "review_text": "If you are a family of 3 or 4 who needs an affordable, safe and comfortable place to stay in Vegas for a few days, this Holiday Inn resort will not disappoint.PROs:\u25a0 No resort fees! A major pain point for visitors to Vegas - it's just another way for most other Vegas hotels to charge for things that are usually included in other city hotels. Just say \"NO\" to resort fees or more places (following the bad habits of US airlines) will start nickel-and-diming you.\u25a0 Another Holiday Inn difference - their large fridge was empty so that you could stock it with things you want. Unlike other hotels that stock their small fridges with their overpriced drinks and alcohols, I loved the clean and empty fridge in my suite.\u25a0 There was a very responsive and cold air conditioner to keep our 1 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor cool and comfortable from the hot Vegas weather outside.\u25a0 The apartment was well equipped and spacious with a separate toilet closet from the main bathroom with showers. The bedroom was well decorated with an impressive large walk-in closet. The King bed looked very comfortable but the sofa bed I slept on was a little too springy for my comfort.\u25a0 There was a TV in the bedroom and a TV in the living room - both with loads of channels to keep everyone quite happy. The living room also has a music system if that's your preference.\u25a0 The kitchen was fully equipped with everything you need including a large cold, empty fridge and freezer plus a dishwasher, microwave and stove. Cookware, plates, bowls, cups, glassware and utensils were also included.\u25a0 Free parking and most parking spots are covered - offering shade from the hot summer sun.\u25a0 Good security in the parking lot - the premises were patrolled and entry to the hotel was checked by security guards. Make sure you have your hotel parking placard on display while parked in the parking lot and you'll also need to show the placard to gain entry when you return.\u25a0 The location is quite good - not too close to the strip for the noise or craziness, and not too far that you can't walk to the strip i.e. you're only a block away from the LINQ ferris wheel.CONs:\u25a0 No free breakfast for IHG Elite members and don't expect any perks (upgrades, freebies, etc) as this is a vacation \"resort\" that is otherwise a time-share for some owners.\u25a0 Unfortunately, this resort is not quite a full service hotel and it shows. They didn't make up the bed or clean the apartment until early evening. Even then, the cleaning crew just stuffed the used towels in a bag which they left outside the apartment. BTW, by making up the bed, I was using the term loosely - they probably just spent a minute to straighten the sheets and pillows in the bedroom and didn't bother to touch the messy sofa bed in the living room. They probably spend a total of 5 minutes at most \"cleaning\" the apartment.\u25a0 During the late apartment clean-up, they didn't bother to re-stock the bathroom with new towels. Had to call the front desk about 3 times before someone came an hour later to drop off the towels.\u25a0 Our reservation was for 3 adults and so, they should have assumed that we'll need the sofa bed in the living room and had someone make up the bed. At any other regular hotel, it would either be made up already or you can call someone to come in to make it up. I didn't bother calling them as I found the sheets and blankets for the sofa bed in the walk-in closet of the bedroom and made the sofa bed up myself.\u25a0 Being an apartment unit that works well for families, there will be lots of kids and teenagers running about. Ask for a unit away from the pool if you don't want to be disturbed. Still... kids were running up and down the stairs between shared units at all hours of the day.TIPs:\u25a0 Get a room on the 3rd floor if you don't want anybody above you. However, note that there are no elevators to get you to the 3rd floor - just stairs.\u25a0 Get a schedule for the free shuttles to various casinos on the strip if you don't want to drive around Vegas.\u25a0 Don't unload your car before you check-in as you'll likely need to drive to a parking spot closer to your apartment. The front desk will tell you where your unit is and where to park close to your unit during check-in.In summary, as long as you don't need to a full-service cleaning crew or staff, HICV is an excellent choice for small families who wants a comfortable, spacious respite from the hustle of Vegas.PS: If you found this review useful, please give it a \"Helpful\" vote.

The maid service was perfect; we never, even once, had to ask for anything.....a Vegas first for us!  We loved our view also!"

The staff always makes me feel right at home and will do whatever it takes to make sure I have whatever I need for a great stay. The rooms are always clean and stylish and I love the bar. It's my go to place to stay in sf!"

        "review_text": "I don't know why I was expecting more from this hotel, but I've had better experiences in a Holiday Inn.  The staff was untrained and unpolished offering the bare minimum of service and seemed pretty inconvenienced with the simplest (like an extra room key). The quality of the renovation felt cheep and rushed and was very surprising.  I was expecting a lot more, but it seemed unfinished with some real tacky design choices.  The room was okay, nothing great and certainly not worth the price.  I've stayed at a few Trump hotels and while they are certainly not the best this one seems to be the worst.  Maybe the organization in charge of this assignment was distracted or something, because they really missed the mark here.   In a city with so many good high-end lodging options I'd look elsewhere and will not be back."

        "review_text": "We stayed in the Carlton Hotel for two nights during our stay in San Francisco and it was great. We arrived early and our bags were looked after by the day staff whilst we explored the city. The hotel staff arranged our big bus tour tickets and advised us where to go. When we returned to check into our room we were met by the night staff who were excellent fun and very helpful. We were welcomed in by the night supervisor who was the spitting image of Errol Brown of Hot Chocolate fame! He gave us both a glass of wine (which is free to all guests at 17:30) and when he discovered it was our honeymoon he gave us a bottle to enjoy in our room which was a lovely touch. We went out again to get some food and upon our return a few hours later, the staff were all bouncing along to play that funky music whilst going about their tasks. They clearly love their jobs at it gives the hotel a great atmosphere in line with the city. Well done to all involved!"

        "review_text": "the interiors were what you would expect from the king of casinos... gaudy and disney-esque. there is a cheapness to the quality of the rooms underneath the cliche attempts at its 'luxury' looks. the restaurant and bar were overpriced for the quality. does not compare to the four seasons and regret the choice."

        "review_text": "The service is spotty.  So many little things... like having to call 3 times to get room service, forgetting which newspapers I requested, doormen rarely present when my arms were full.  No big deal at a Hampton Inn, but you are paying for 5 star service here.   The lobby decor is busy, but still is an impressive space.  But, the rooms.  Ugh... every surface in the room has some kind of brass or gilt on it and wear your sunglasses when you enter the bathroom.   It's all very high-end, no doubt, but it's just awful to my sensibilities."
